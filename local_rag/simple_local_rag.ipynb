There are different ways to preserve food. Some are ancient  methods that have been practiced for generations, such as curing,  smoking, pickling, salting, fermenting, canning, and preserving fruit  in the form of jam. Others include the use of modern techniques and  technology, including drying, vacuum packing, pasteurization, and  freezing and refrigeration. Preservation guards against foodborne  illnesses, and also protects the flavor, color, moisture content, or  nutritive value of food.  Food Irradiation: What You Need to Know  Irradiation  does  not  make  foods  radioactive,  compromise  nutritional quality, or noticeably change the taste, texture, or  appearance of food. In fact, any changes made by irradiation are so  minimal that it is not easy to tell if a food has been irradiated.  Food irradiation (the application of ionizing radiation to food) is  a technology that improves the safety and extends the shelf life  of foods by reducing or eliminating microorganisms and insects.  Like pasteurizing milk and canning fruits and vegetables, irradiation  can make food safer for the consumer. The Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) is responsible for regulating the sources of  radiation that are used to irradiate food. The FDA approves a source  of radiation for use on foods only after it has determined that  irradiating the food is safe.  Food Preservation  |  1019'},\n",

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals.

These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is  stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber  is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by  digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes  through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that  inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.  One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of  energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to  providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger  macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning  of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose  can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage  molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is  known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.  Lipids  Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,  and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.  Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy  products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three  main  types  of  lipids  are  triglycerides  (triacylglycerols),  phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or  store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than  carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four  kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy  storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,  surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide  insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other  functions in the body.  6  |  Introduction',\n",

There are five key factors that make  up a healthful diet:  1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of  each essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories.  2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient  at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts  of all nutrients.  3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you  get from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of  energy you expend during your day’s activities.  4. Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too  much nor too little.  5. Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each  of the food groups on a regular basis.  A healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative  to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh  whole foods that have been sustaining people for generations.  Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein,  carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health.  Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients  and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and  trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of  diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer,  obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses.

Monitor food portions. For optimum weight maintenance, it is  important to ensure that energy consumed from foods meets the  energy expenditures required for body functions and activity. If not,  the excess energy contributes to gradual, steady accumulation of  stored body fat and weight gain. In order to lose body fat, you need  to ensure that more calories are burned than consumed. Likewise,  in order to gain weight, calories must be eaten in excess of what is  expended daily.  Variety  Variety involves eating different foods from all the food groups.  Eating a varied diet helps to ensure that you consume and absorb  adequate amounts of all essential nutrients required for health. One  of the major drawbacks of a monotonous diet is the risk of  consuming too much of some nutrients and not enough of others.  Trying new foods can also be a source of pleasure—you never know  what foods you might like until you try them.  Developing a healthful diet can be rewarding, but be mindful that  all of the principles presented must be followed to derive maximal  health benefits. For instance, introducing variety in your diet can  still result in the consumption of too many high-calorie, nutrient  poor foods and inadequate nutrient intake if you do not also employ  moderation and calorie control.

It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry.  In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins.

Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that  also contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach. These  gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that  chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food.  The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the  macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein  meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates.  It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach  contents completely into the small intestine.  The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the  duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the  duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas  and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in  digestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of  pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day. This  fluid consists mostly of water, but it also contains bicarbonate ions  that neutralize the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and  enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and  lipids. The gallbladder secretes a much smaller amount of a fluid  called bile that helps to digest fats. Bile passes through a duct that  joins the pancreatic ducts and is released into the duodenum. Bile  is made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bile’s components  act like detergents by surrounding fats similar to the way dish soap  removes grease from a frying pan. This allows for the movement of  fats in the watery environment of the small intestine. Two different  types of muscular contractions, called peristalsis and segmentation,  control the movement and mixing of the food in various stages of  digestion through the small intestine.  Similar to what occurs in the esophagus and stomach, peristalsis  is circular waves of smooth muscle contraction that propel food  74  |  The Digestive System',\n",

Just as too much glucose is bad for other organs,  such as the kidneys and pancreas, it also produces negative effects  upon the brain. Excessive glucose levels in the blood can cause a  loss of cognitive function, and chronically high blood-glucose levels  can damage brain cells. The brain’s cognitive functions include  language processing, learning, perceiving, and thinking. Recent  scientific studies demonstrate that having continuously high blood- glucose levels substantially elevates the risk for developing  Alzheimer’s disease, which is the greatest cause of age-related  cognitive decline.  The good news is that much research is directed toward  determining the best diets and foods that slow cognitive decline and  maximize brain health. A study in the June 2010 issue of the Archives  of Neurology reports that people over age 65 who adhered to diets  that consisted of higher intakes of nuts, fish, poultry, tomatoes,  cruciferous vegetables, fruits, salad dressing, and dark green, and  leafy vegetables, as well as a lower intake of high-fat dairy products,  red meat, organ meat, and butter, had a much reduced risk for  Alzheimer’s disease.1  Other scientific studies provide supporting evidence that foods  rich in omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants provide the brain  with protection against Alzheimer’s disease.

The glands  secrete hormones, which are biological molecules that regulate  cellular processes in other target tissues, so they require  transportation by the circulatory system. Adequate nutrition is  critical for the functioning of all the glands in the endocrine system.  A protein deficiency impairs gonadal-hormone release, preventing  reproduction. Athletic teenage girls with very little body fat often  do not menstruate. Children who are malnourished usually do not  produce enough growth hormone and fail to reach normal height  for their age group. Probably the most popularized connection  between nutrition and the functions of the endocrine system is  that unhealthy dietary patterns are linked to obesity and the  development of Type 2 diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) estimates that twenty-six million Americans  have Type 2 diabetes as of 2011. This is 8.3 percent of the US  population. Counties with the highest incidence of obesity also have  the highest incidence of Type 2 diabetes. To see how the rise in  obesity in this country is paralleled by the rise in Type 2 diabetes,  review this report by the CDC.  https:/ /www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/slides/ maps_diabetesobesity_trends.pdf\\xa0 What is the causal relationship between overnutrition and Type  2 diabetes? The prevailing theory is that the overconsumption of  high-fat and high-sugar foods causes changes in muscle, fat, and  liver cells that leads to a diminished response from the pancreatic  hormone insulin. These cells are called “insulin-resistant.” Insulin is  released after a meal and instructs the liver and other tissues to take  up glucose and fatty acids that are circulating in the blood. When  cells are resistant to insulin they do not take up enough glucose and  fatty acids, so glucose and fatty acids remain at high concentrations  in the blood. The chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids in the  blood also causes damage to other tissues over time, so that people  who have Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular  disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye disease.

The skeleton is composed of two main  parts, the axial and the appendicular parts. The axial skeleton  consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, and is  composed of eighty bones. The appendicular skeleton consists of  the shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, and upper and lower extremities,  and is composed of 126 bones. Bones are also categorized by size  and shape. There are four types of bone: long bones, short bones,  flat bones, and irregular bones. The longest bone in your body is the  femur (thigh bone), which extends from your hip to your knee. It is a  long bone and functions to support your weight as you stand, walk,  or run. Your wrist is composed of eight irregular-shaped bones,  which allow for the intricate movements of your hands. Your twelve  ribs on each side of your body are curved flat bones that protect  your heart and lungs. Thus, the bones’ different sizes and shapes  allow for their different functions.  Bones are composed of approximately 65 percent inorganic  material known as mineralized matrix. This mineralized matrix  consists of mostly crystallized hydroxyapatite. The bone’s hard  crystal matrix of bone tissue gives it its rigid structure. The other  35 percent of bone is organic material, most of which is the fibrous  protein collagen. The collagen fibers are networked throughout  bone tissue and provide it with flexibility and strength. The bones’  inorganic and organic materials are structured into two different  tissue types. There is spongy bone, also called trabecular or  cancellous bone, and compact bone, also called cortical bone  (Figure 2.26 “The Arrangement of Bone Tissues”). The two tissue  types differ in their microarchitecture and porosity. Trabecular  bone is 50 to 90 percent porous and appears as a lattice-like  structure under the microscope.

Bone Modeling and Remodeling  During infancy, childhood, and adolescence, bones are continuously  growing and changing shape through two processes called growth  (ossification) and modeling. In fact, in the first year of life, almost  100 percent of the bone tissue in the skeleton is replaced. In the  process of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built  up at a different site. In adulthood, our bones stop growing and  modeling, but continue to go through a process of bone remodeling.  In the process of remodeling, bone tissue is degraded and built up  at the same location. About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled  each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting  upon them, even in adulthood. This phenomenon is called Wolff’s  law, which states that bones will develop a structure that is best  able to resist the forces acting upon them. This is why exercising,  especially when it involves weight-bearing activities, increases bone  strength.  The first step in bone remodeling is osteocyte activation.  Osteocytes  detect  changes  in  mechanical  forces,  calcium  homeostasis, or hormone levels. In the second step, osteoclasts are  recruited to the site of the degradation. Osteoclasts are large cells  with a highly irregular ruffled membrane. These cells fuse tightly  to the bone and secrete hydrogen ions, which acidify the local  environment and dissolve the minerals in the bone tissue matrix.  This process is called bone resorption and resembles pit excavation.  Our bodies excavate pits in our bone tissue because bones act as  storehouses for calcium and other minerals.

Similar  to measuring blood pressure to predict the risk of stroke, a BMD  measurement can help predict the risk of bone fracture. The most  common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray  absorptiometry (DEXA). During this procedure, a person lies on  their back and a DEXA scanner passes two X-ray beams through  their body. The amount of X-ray energy that passes through the  bone is measured for both beams. The total amount of the X-ray  energy that passes through a person varies depending on their bone  thickness. Using this information and a defined area of bone, the  amount of calcified tissue in grams per unit area (cm2) is calculated.  Most often the DEXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip  and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of  overall bone strength and health. DEXA is the cheapest and most  accurate way to measure BMD. It also uses the lowest dose of  radiation. Other methods of measuring BMD include quantitative  computed tomography (QCT) and radiographic absorptiometry.  People at risk for developing bone disease are advised to have a  DEXA scan. We will discuss the many risk factors linked to an  increased incidence of osteoporosis and the steps a person can take  to prevent the disease from developing.

BMI Limitations  A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account  fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional  predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass.  Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body  fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more  muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more  muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary  individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular  athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more  overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is  an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older  person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower  BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis,  even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass.  BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly  correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to  diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.

The  processes involved keep fluids from becoming too dilute or too  concentrated. Fluid compartments are separated by selectively  permeable membranes, which allow some things, such as water,  to move through while other substances require special transport  proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water  between fluid compartments happens by osmosis, which is simply  the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane  from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it  is not so concentrated. Water is never transported actively; that is,  it never takes energy for water to move between compartments.  Although cells do not directly control water movement, they do  control movement of electrolytes and other solutes and thus  indirectly regulate water movement by controlling where there will  be regions of high and low concentrations.  Cells maintain their water volume at a constant level, but the  composition of solutes in a cell is in a continuous state of flux.  This is because cells are bringing nutrients in, metabolizing them,  and disposing of waste products. To maintain water balance a cell  controls the movement of electrolytes to keep the total number of  dissolved particles, called osmolality the same inside and outside  (Figure 3.3 “Osmoregulation”). The total number of dissolved  substances is the same inside and outside a cell, but the  composition of the fluids differs between compartments.

Mucus is composed of more than 90 percent  water and a front-line defense against injury and foreign invaders.  It protects tissues from irritants, entraps pathogens, and contains  immune-system cells that destroy pathogens. Water is also the main  component of the lubricating fluid between joints and eases the  movement of articulated bones.  The aqueous and vitreous humors, which are fluids that fill the  extra space in the eyes and the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding  the brain and spinal cord, are primarily water and buffer these  organs against sudden changes in the environment. Watery fluids  surrounding organs provide both chemical and mechanical  protection.

Human life  is supported within a narrow range of temperature, with the  temperature set point of the body being 98.6°F (37°C).

There are several mechanisms in place that move body water  from place to place as a method to distribute heat in the body and  equalize body temperature (Figure 3.4 “Thermoregulatory Center”).  The hypothalamus in the brain is the thermoregulatory center. The  hypothalamus contains special protein sensors that detect blood  temperature. The skin also contains temperature sensors that  respond quickly to changes in immediate surroundings. In response  to cold sensors in the skin, a neural signal is sent to the  hypothalamus, which then sends a signal to smooth muscle tissue  surrounding blood vessels causing them to constrict and reduce  blood flow. This reduces heat lost to the environment. The  hypothalamus also sends signals to muscles to erect hairs and shiver  and to endocrine glands like the thyroid to secrete hormones  capable of ramping up metabolism.

The thirst mechanism is activated in response to changes in water  volume in the blood, but is even more sensitive to changes in blood  osmolality. Blood osmolality is primarily driven by the concentration  of sodium cations. The urge to drink results from a complex  interplay of hormones and neuronal responses that coordinate to  increase water input and contribute toward fluid balance and  composition in the body. The “thirst center” is contained within  the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain that lies just above the  brainstem. In older people the thirst mechanism is not as responsive  and as we age there is a higher risk for dehydration. Thirst happens  in the following sequence of physiological events:  1. Receptor proteins in the kidney, heart, and hypothalamus  detect decreased fluid volume or increased sodium  concentration in the blood.  2. Hormonal and neural messages are relayed to the brain’s thirst  center in the hypothalamus.  The hypothalamus sends neural signals to higher sensory areas  in the cortex of the brain, stimulating the conscious thought to  drink.  3. Fluids are consumed.  4. Receptors in the mouth and stomach detect mechanical  movements involved with fluid ingestion.  5. Neural signals are sent to the brain and the thirst mechanism  is shut off.  The physiological control of thirst is the backup mechanism to  increase water input. Fluid intake is controlled primarily by  conscious eating and drinking habits dependent on social and  cultural influences. For example, you might have a habit of drinking  a glass of orange juice and eating a bowl of cereal every morning  before school or work.  166  |  Regulation of Water Balance',\n",

Sweat  is mostly water but also contains some electrolytes, mostly sodium  and chloride. Under normal environmental conditions (i.e., not hot,  humid days) water and sodium loss through sweat is negligible,  but is highly variable among individuals. It is estimated that sixty  minutes of high-intensity physical activity, like playing a game of  tennis, can produce approximately one liter of sweat; however the  amount of sweat produced is highly dependent on environmental  conditions. A liter of sweat typically contains between 1 and 2 grams  of sodium and therefore exercising for multiple hours can result in a  high amount of sodium loss in some people. Additionally, hard labor  can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case,  the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal.  In athletes hyponatremia, or a low blood-sodium level, is not  so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather  drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium  concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and  diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia. The symptoms of  hyponatremia, also called water intoxication (since it is often the  root cause) include nausea, muscle cramps, confusion, dizziness,  and in severe cases, coma and death. The physiological events that  occur in water intoxication are the following:  1. Excessive sodium loss and/or water intake.  2. Sodium levels fall in blood and in the fluid between cells.  3. Water moves to where solutes are more concentrated (i.e. into  cells).  4. Cells swell.  5.

       "  'text': 'Potassium  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Potassium is the most abundant positively charged ion inside of  cells. Ninety percent of potassium exists in intracellular fluid, with  about 10 percent in extracellular fluid, and only 1 percent in blood  plasma. As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly  regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls  potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play  a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal  glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting  ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number  of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more  potassium is excreted. Because potassium is required for  maintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200  milligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day.  Other Functions of Potassium in the Body  Nerve impulse involves not only sodium, but also potassium. A nerve  impulse moves along a nerve via the movement of sodium ions into  the cell. To end the impulse, potassium ions rush out of the nerve  cell, thereby decreasing the positive charge inside the nerve cell.  This diminishes the stimulus. To restore the original concentrations  of ions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium ions out in exchange for  potassium  ions  in.  On  completion  of  the  restored  ion  concentrations, a nerve cell is now ready to receive the next  impulse. Similarly, in muscle cells potassium is involved in restoring  the normal membrane potential and ending the muscle contraction.  Potassium  |  195',\n",

About  15 percent of Americans obtain drinking water from private wells,  which are not subject to EPA standards.  Producing water safe for drinking involves some or all of the  following processes: screening out large objects, removing excess  calcium carbonate from hard water sources, flocculation, which  adds a precipitating agent to remove solid particles, clarification,  sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. These processes aim to  remove unhealthy substances and produce high-quality, colorless,  odorless, good-tasting water.  Most drinking water is disinfected by the process of chlorination,  which involves adding chlorine compounds to the water.  Chlorination is cheap and effective at killing bacteria.

Health Benefits  The most renowned effects of caffeine on the body are increased  alertness and delay of fatigue and sleep. How does caffeine  stimulate the brain? Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in  our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific  protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects  the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase  in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the  brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep.  At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and  interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as  shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia. People’s sensitivity to the adverse  effects of caffeine varies and some people develop side effects at  much lower doses. The many effects caffeine has on the brain do  not diminish with habitual drinking of caffeinated beverages.  Tools for Change  Consuming caffeine in the evening and in the middle of the night  will help keep you awake to study for an exam, but it will not  enhance your performance on the next day’s test if you do not get  enough sleep. Drink caffeinated beverages in moderation at any  time of the day or evening to increase alertness (if you are not  sensitive to caffeine’s adverse effects), but get the recommended  amount of sleep.

A well-concocted sports drink contains  sugar, water, and sodium in the correct proportions so that  hydration is optimized. The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood- glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete  hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces  some of that lost in sweat. The American College of Sports Medicine  states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent  dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance.  The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity  is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many  factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and  type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal  endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by  measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in  weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.  The primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium. One liter of sweat  can contain between 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium. Potassium,  magnesium, and calcium are also lost, but in much lower amounts. If  you are exercising at high intensity for greater than ninety minutes,  it is important to replace sodium as well as water. This can be partly  accomplished by consuming a sports drink. The highest content of  sodium in commercial sports drinks is approximately 450 milligrams  per liter and thus will not replace all lost sodium unless a person  drinks several liters. This is NOT recommended, as water  intoxication not only compromises performance, but may also be  deadly. The sodium in sports drinks enhances fluid absorption so  that rehydration is more efficiently accomplished. If you are not  exercising for more than ninety minutes at a high intensity, dietary  intake of sodium and other electrolytes should be sufficient for  replacing lost electrolytes.

Figure 4.1 Carbohydrate Classification Scheme  Carbohydrates are a group of organic compounds containing a ratio  of one carbon atom to two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom.  Basically, they are hydrated carbons. The word “carbo” means  carbon and “hydrate” means water. Glucose, the most abundant  carbohydrate in the human body, has six carbon atoms, twelve  hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. The chemical formula for  glucose is written as C6H12O6. Synonymous with the term  carbohydrate is the Greek word “saccharide,” which means sugar.  The simplest unit of a carbohydrate is a monosaccharide.

Only  about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth. (This  is a good thing as more glucose in the mouth would lead to more  tooth decay.) When carbohydrates reach the stomach no further  chemical breakdown occurs because the amylase enzyme does not  function in the acidic conditions of the stomach.

The type of carbohydrate within a food affects the GI along with  its fat and fiber content. Increased fat and fiber in foods increases  the time required for digestion and delays the rate of gastric  emptying into the small intestine which, ultimately reduces the GI.  Processing and cooking also affects a food’s GI by increasing their  digestibility. Advancements in the technologies of food processing  and the high consumer demand for convenient, precooked foods in  the United States has created foods that are digested and absorbed  more rapidly, independent of the fiber content. Modern breakfast  cereals, breads, pastas, and many prepared foods have a high GI.  In contrast, most raw foods have a lower GI. (However, the more  ripened a fruit or vegetable is, the higher its GI.)  The GI can be used as a guide for choosing healthier carbohydrate  choices but has some limitations.

In regard to refined grains, there  are no studies that show consumption of refined grains increases  weight gain or disease risk.

The Most Notorious Sugar  Before high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) was marketed as the best  food and beverage sweetener, sucrose (table sugar) was the  number-one sweetener in America. (Recall that sucrose, or table  sugar, is a disaccharide consisting of one glucose unit and one  fructose unit.) HFCS also contains the simple sugars fructose and  glucose, but with fructose at a slightly higher concentration. In  the production of HFCS, corn starch is broken down to glucose,  and some of the glucose is then converted to fructose. Fructose  is sweeter than glucose; hence many food manufacturers choose  to sweeten foods with HFCS. HFCS is used as a sweetener for  carbonated beverages, condiments, cereals, and a great variety of  other processed foods.  Some scientists, public health personnel, and healthcare  providers believe that fructose is the cause of the obesity epidemic  and its associated health consequences. The majority of their  evidence stems from the observation that since the early 1970s  the number of overweight or obese Americans has dramatically  increased and so has the consumption of foods containing HFCS.  However, as discussed, so has the consumption of added sugars  in general. Animal studies that fuel the fructose opponents show  fructose is not used to produce energy in the body; instead it is  mostly converted to fat in the liver—potentially contributing to  insulin resistance and the development of Type 2 diabetes.

Now that we know the benefits of eating the right  carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to  promote health and prevent disease.  How Many Carbohydrates Does a Person Need?  The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended  Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults  at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the  brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient  Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and  65 percent of your total caloric daily intake. This means that on  a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225  and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM  not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come  from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA  recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less  of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes  for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women,  respectively. The recommendations for dietary fiber are based upon  the intake levels known to prevent against heart disease.

It’s the Whole Nutrient Package  In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are  those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential  nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense  carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain  breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and  beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly  processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks,  cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie  carbohydrates.  They  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‘bad  carbohydrates,’ as they are known to cause health problems when  consumed in excess.  Understanding Carbohydrates from Product  Information  While nutrition facts labels aid in determining the amount of  carbohydrates you eat, they do not help in determining whether  a food is refined or not. The ingredients list provides some help  in this regard. It identifies all of the food’s ingredients in order of  concentration, with the most concentrated ingredient first.

To accomplish  these recommendations use some or all of the following  suggestions:  • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by  eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain  bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of  beans and/or nuts with dinner.  • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the  grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole  grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of  whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown  rice, or whole-wheat pasta.  Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so  choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal  listed as the first ingredient.  • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour.  • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a  Kaiser roll or baguette.  Add beans, nuts, or seeds to salad—they add texture and taste.  • Choose whole-grain pastas and brown rice, cook al dente, and  add some beans and vegetables in equal portions.  • Change it up a bit and experience the taste and satisfaction of  other whole grains such as barley, quinoa, and bulgur.  • Eat snacks high in fiber, such as almonds, pistachios, raisins,  and air-popped popcorn.

The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of  Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes  In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing  carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of  functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk,  coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning  capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the  different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods.  Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making  jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses,  and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture  to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases  bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but  also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the  combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as  a glossy appearance and smooth texture.  Due to the potential health consequences of consuming too many  added sugars, sugar substitutes have replaced them in many foods  and beverages.

So, normal fat reserves are a signal that metabolic processes  are efficient and a person is healthy.  Lipids are a family of organic compounds that are mostly insoluble  in water. Composed of fats and oils, lipids are molecules that yield  high energy and have a chemical composition mainly of carbon,  hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids perform three primary biological  functions within the body: they serve as structural components of  cell membranes, function as energy storehouses, and function as  important signaling molecules.  The three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids,  and sterols. Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids  in the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil,  butter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats.  Naturally occurring triglycerides are found in many foods, including  avocados, olives, corn, and nuts. We commonly call the triglycerides  in our food “fats” and “oils.” Fats are lipids that are solid at room  temperature, whereas oils are liquid. As with most fats, triglycerides  do not dissolve in water. The terms fats, oils, and triglycerides are  discretionary and can be used interchangeably. In this chapter when  we use the word fat, we are referring to triglycerides.  Phospholipids make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids.  They are water-soluble and are found in both plants and animals.  Phospholipids are crucial for building the protective barrier, or  membrane, around your body’s cells. In fact, phospholipids are  synthesized in the body to form cell and organelle membranes. In  blood and body fluids, phospholipids form structures in which fat is  enclosed and transported throughout the bloodstream.  Sterols are the least common type of lipid. Cholesterol is perhaps  the best well-known sterol. Though cholesterol has a notorious  reputation, the body gets only a small amount of its cholesterol  through food—the body produces most of it. Cholesterol is an  important component of the cell membrane and is required for the  synthesis of sex hormones, and bile salts.  Introduction  |  293',\n",

Foods that are  high in fat contain more calories than foods high in protein or  carbohydrates. As a result, high-fat foods are a convenient source  of energy. For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories  of energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of  carbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity  and on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person  to person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the  high-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing  children require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth  and development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for  an extended period, growth and development will not progress  normally.

The circulatory system, respiratory system, integumentary system,  immune system, brain, and other organs require fatty acids for  proper function. The body is capable of synthesizing most of the  fatty acids it needs from food. These fatty acids are known as  nonessential fatty acids. However, there are some fatty acids that  the body cannot synthesize and these are called essential fatty  acids. It is important to note that nonessential fatty acids doesn’t  mean unimportant; the classification is based solely on the ability of  the body to synthesize the fatty acid.  Essential fatty acids must be obtained from food. They fall into  two categories—omega-3 and omega-6. The 3 and 6 refer to the  position of the first carbon double bond and the omega refers to  the methyl end of the chain. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids  are precursors to important compounds called eicosanoids.  Eicosanoids are powerful hormones that control many other  hormones and important body functions, such as the central  nervous system and the immune system. Eicosanoids derived from  omega-6 fatty acids are known to increase blood pressure, immune  response, and inflammation. In contrast, eicosanoids derived from  omega-3 fatty acids are known to have heart-healthy effects. Given  the contrasting effects of the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, a  proper dietary balance between the two must be achieved to ensure  optimal health benefits.

As we uncover what  hydrogenation is and why manufacturers use it, you will be better  equipped to adhere to healthier dietary choices and promote your  heart health.  Hydrogenation: The Good Gone Bad?  Food manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to  attack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation  render them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules  attack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes  oxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives  the food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can  undergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be  stored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to  minimize damage from oxidation. Hydrogenation poses a solution  that food manufacturers prefer.  When lipids are subjected to hydrogenation, the molecular  structure of the fat is altered. Hydrogenation is the process of  adding hydrogen to unsaturated fatty-acid chains, so that the  hydrogen atoms are connected to the points of saturation and  results in a more saturated fatty acid.

The 2015-2020 US Dietary Guidelines  suggest limiting saturated fats, thereby indirectly limiting dietary  cholesterol since foods that are high in cholesterol tend to be high  in saturated fats also.  A Prelude to Disease  If left unchecked, improper dietary fat consumption can lead down  a path to severe health problems. An increased level of lipids,  triglycerides, and cholesterol in the blood is called hyperlipidemia.  Hyperlipidemia is inclusive of several conditions but more  commonly refers to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. When  blood lipid levels are high, any number of adverse health problems  may ensue. Consider the following:  • Cardiovascular disease. According to the AHA, cardiovascular  disease encompasses a variety of problems, many of which are  related to the process of atherosclerosis. Over time the  arteries thicken and harden with plaque buildup, causing  restricted or at times low or no blood flow to selected areas of  the body.  • Heart attack.

Limiting the intake of saturated fats and trans fats,  increasing physical activity, and eating fewer calories are all  equally important in this fight against obesity.  What You Can Do  Remember that saturated fats are found in large amounts in foods  of animal origin. They should be limited within the diet.  Polyunsaturated fats are generally obtained from non-animal  sources. While they are beneficial for lowering bad cholesterol they  also lower good cholesterol. They are better for you than saturated  fats but are not to be consumed in excess. Monounsaturated fats  are of plant origin and are found in most nuts, seeds, seed oils, olive  oil, canola oil, and legumes. Monounsaturated fats are excellent  because they not only lower bad cholesterol, but also they elevate  the good cholesterol. Replace current dietary fats with an increased  intake of monounsaturated fats.  Choose whole-grain and high-fiber foods. Reduced risk for  cardiovascular disease has been associated with diets that are high  in whole grains and fiber. Fiber also slows down cholesterol  absorption. The AHA recommends that at least half of daily grain  intake should originate from whole grains. The Adequate Intake  value for fiber is 14 grams per 1,000 kilocalories. These amounts  are based upon the amount of fiber that has been shown to reduce  cardiovascular risk.  Do not be sedentary. Get more exercise on a regular basis.  Increasing your energy expenditure by just twenty minutes of  physical activity at least three times per week will improve your  overall health.

Too  much of these ingredients can also cause health problems.  Choose and consume wisely.  • A “better-fat” diet will successfully support weight loss.  While cutting “Least Desirable” fat calories are vital to weight  loss, remember that “Better” fats are filling and just a handful  of nuts can curb an appetite to prevent overeating.  • Consume omega-3 fats each day. For optimal health and  disease prevention include a moderate serving of fish, walnuts,  ground flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, or soybean oil in your diet every  day.  • How much saturated fat is too much? Your goal is to keep  your intake of saturated fat to no more than 10 percent of your  total dietary calories on a daily basis. Thus, it is important to  learn to reduce the intake of foods high in saturated fat. High- fat foods can be consumed but they must fall within the overall  goal for a person’s fat allowance for the day.  • Home cooking. Limit the use of saturated fats in home  preparation of meals. Instead of butter try spreads made from  unsaturated oils such as canola or olive oils and the use of  cooking sprays. Couple this with the use of herbs and spices to  add flavor. Avoid using high-fat meat gravies, cheese, and  cream sauces. Limit adding extras to foods such as butter on a  baked potato. Use nonfat sour cream instead. Grill, bake, stir- fry, roast, or bake your foods. Never fry in solid fats such as  butter or shortening. Marinate foods to be grilled in fruit juices  and herbs. Instead of relying upon commercial salad dressings,  learn to make your own top-quality dressing from cold- pressed olive oil, flaxseed oil, or sesame oil.  • Make sure the fat is flavorful.

The word protein is a Greek word,  meaning “of utmost importance.” Proteins are called the workhorses  of life as they provide the body with structure and perform a vast  array of functions. You can stand, walk, run, skate, swim, and more  because of your protein-rich muscles. Protein is necessary for  proper immune system function, digestion, and hair and nail  growth, and is involved in numerous other body functions. In fact,  it is estimated that more than one hundred thousand different  proteins exist within the human body. In this chapter you will learn  about the components of protein, the important roles that protein  serves within the body, how the body uses protein, the risks and  consequences associated with too much or too little protein, and  where to find healthy sources of it in your diet.  What Is Protein?  Proteins, simply put, are macromolecules composed of amino acids.  Amino acids are commonly called protein’s building blocks. Proteins  are crucial for the nourishment, renewal, and continuance of life.  Proteins contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen just  as carbohydrates and lipids do, but proteins are the only  macronutrient that contains nitrogen. In each amino acid the  elements are arranged into a specific conformation around a carbon  center. Each amino acid consists of a central carbon atom  connected to a side chain, a hydrogen, a nitrogen-containing amino  group, and a carboxylic acid group—hence the name “amino acid.”  Defining Protein  |  363',\n",

The teeth begin the  mechanical breakdown of the large egg pieces into smaller pieces  that can be swallowed. The salivary glands provide some saliva to  aid swallowing and the passage of the partially mashed egg through  the esophagus. The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach through  the esophageal sphincter. The stomach releases gastric juices  containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate  the breakdown of the protein.

The body has several systems that hold  the blood pH within the normal range to prevent this from  happening. One of these is the circulating albumin. Albumin is  slightly acidic, and because it is negatively charged it balances the  many positively charged molecules, such as protons (H+), calcium,  potassium, and magnesium which are also circulating in the blood.  Albumin acts as a buffer against abrupt changes in the  concentrations of these molecules, thereby balancing blood pH and  maintaining the status quo. The protein hemoglobin also  participates in acid-base balance by binding and releasing protons.  Transport  Albumin and hemoglobin also play a role in molecular transport.  Albumin chemically binds to hormones, fatty acids, some vitamins,  essential minerals, and drugs, and transports them throughout the  circulatory system. Each red blood cell contains millions of  hemoglobin molecules that bind oxygen in the lungs and transport it  to all the tissues in the body. A cell’s plasma membrane is usually not  permeable to large polar molecules, so to get the required nutrients  and molecules into the cell many transport proteins exist in the  cell membrane.

Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration  Proteins are involved in all aspects of wound healing, a process  that takes place in three phases: inflammatory, proliferative, and  remodeling. For example, if you were sewing and pricked your  finger with a needle, your flesh would turn red and become  inflamed. Within a few seconds bleeding would stop. The healing  process begins with proteins such as bradykinin, which dilate blood  vessels at the site of injury. An additional protein called fibrin helps  to secure platelets that form a clot to stop the bleeding. Next, in  the proliferative phase, cells move in and mend the injured tissue by  installing newly made collagen fibers. The collagen fibers help pull  the wound edges together. In the remodeling phase, more collagen  is deposited, forming a scar. Scar tissue is only about 80 percent  as functional as normal uninjured tissue.

Subsequently the child was fed watery  porridge made from low-protein grains, which accounts for the low  protein intake.

Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted  The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which  maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The  RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance.  Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino  acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are  catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver  breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly  converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then  transported to the kidneys for excretion. Most nitrogen is lost as  urea in the urine, but urea is also excreted in the feces. Proteins are  also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore,  is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to  balance the amount of protein used up and lost from the body. For  healthy adults, this amount of protein was determined to be 0.8  grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. You can calculate  410  |  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices',\n",

The IOM used data from multiple studies that determined  nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the  RDA for protein. A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the  nitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A  person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted  nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is  breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of  imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such  as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein  diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in  less protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance  occurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken  in by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these  times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more  of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A  person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen  balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.

During exercise, especially when it is performed for  longer than two to three hours, muscle tissue is broken down and  some of the amino acids are catabolized to fuel muscle contraction.  To avert excessive borrowing of amino acids from muscle tissue to  synthesize energy during prolonged exercise, protein needs to be  obtained from the diet. Intense exercise, such as strength training,  stresses muscle tissue so that afterward, the body adapts by  building bigger, stronger, and healthier muscle tissue. The body  requires protein post-exercise to accomplish this.

Recommended protein intakes for strength-trained athletes  range from approximately 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of  weight per day.

       "  'text': 'Health Consequences of  Alcohol Abuse  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Alcoholic drinks in excess contribute to weight gain by substantially  increasing caloric intake. However, alcohol displays its two-faced  character again in its effects on body weight, making many scientific  studies contradictory. Multiple studies show high intakes of hard  liquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result  of the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks,  juices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even  more so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and  in some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory  results of scientific studies that have examined the association of  alcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that  alcohol contributes calories to the diet. When alcohol is drunk in  excess, it reduces the secretion of pancreatic juice and damages the  lining of the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrient digestion  and absorption. The impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients  in alcoholics contributes to their characteristic “skinniness” and  multiple associated micronutrient deficiencies. The most common  macronutrient deficiency among alcoholics is water, as it is  excreted  in  excess.

Proper nutrition provides  the necessary nutrients to make the energy that supports life’s  processes. Your body builds new macromolecules from the  nutrients in food.  Nutrient and Energy Flow  Energy is stored in a nutrient’s chemical bonds. Energy comes from  sunlight, which plants capture and, via photosynthesis, use it to  transform carbon dioxide in the air into the molecule glucose. When  the glucose bonds are broken, energy is released. Bacteria, plants,  and animals (including humans) harvest the energy in glucose via a  biological process called cellular respiration. In this process oxygen  is required and the chemical energy of glucose is gradually released  in a series of chemical reactions. Some of this energy is trapped  in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and some is lost as  heat. ATP can be used when needed to drive chemical reactions in  cells that require an input of energy. Cellular respiration requires  oxygen (aerobic) and it is provided as a byproduct of photosynthesis.

As this chain  reaction continues, the permeability and fluidity of cell membranes  changes, proteins in cell membranes experience decreased activity,  and receptor proteins undergo changes in structure that either alter  or stop their function. If receptor proteins designed to react to  insulin levels undergo a structural change it can negatively affect  glucose uptake. Free radical reactions can continue unchecked  unless stopped by a defense mechanism.  The Atom  |  461',\n",

In these tissues it is stored as glycogen, a  highly branched macromolecule consisting of thousands of glucose  molecules held together by chemical bonds. The glucose molecules  are joined together by an anabolic pathway called glycogenesis.  For each molecule of glucose stored, one molecule of ATP is used.  Therefore, it costs energy to store energy. Glycogen levels do not  take long to reach their physiological limit and when this happens  excess glucose will be converted to fat. A cell in positive-energy  balance detects a high concentration of ATP as well as acetyl-CoA  produced by catabolic pathways.

Then we will consider the other  factors that play a role in maintaining energy balance and hence,  body weight.  Estimating Energy Requirement  To maintain body weight you have to balance the calories obtained  from food and beverages with the calories expended every day.  Here, we will discuss how to calculate your energy needs in  kilocalories per day so that you can determine whether your caloric  intake falls short, meets, or exceeds your energy needs. The  Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your  Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). It takes into account your  age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is  a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy  needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is  calculated for those over 18 years of age via the following formulas:  Adult male: EER = 662 − [9.53 X age (y)] + PA X [15.91 X wt (kg) +  5.39.6 X ht (m)]  Adult female: EER = 354 − [6.91 x age (y)] + PA x [9.36 x wt (kg) +  726 x ht (m)]  Note: to convert pounds to kilograms, divide weight in pounds by  2.2. To convert feet to meters, divide height in feet by 3.3.

These values only apply to normal weight adults and not to children  or pregnant or lactating women.

BMR is dependent on body size,  body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, and genetics. People  with a larger frame size have a higher BMR simply because they  have more mass. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue  even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the  higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and  a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than  men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR.  Nutritional status also affects basal metabolism. Caloric restriction,  as occurs while dieting, for example, causes a decline in BMR. This is  because the body attempts to maintain homeostasis and will adapt  by slowing down its basic functions to offset the decrease in energy  intake. Body temperature and thyroid hormone levels are additional  determinants of BMR.

Hunger pangs are real and so is a “growling” stomach. When the  stomach is empty it contracts, producing the characteristic pang  and “growl.” The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural  signals to the hypothalamus, which relays other neural signals to  parts of the brain. This results in the conscious feeling of the need  to eat. Alternatively, after you eat a meal the stomach stretches and  sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety  and relaying the message to stop eating. The stomach also sends out  certain hormones when it is full and others when it is empty. These  hormones communicate to the hypothalamus and other areas of the  brain either to stop eating or to find some food.  Fat tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Fat tissue  produces the hormone leptin, which communicates to the satiety  center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy  486  |  Factors Affecting Energy Intake',\n",

Of course, the sedentary  lifestyle of many North Americans contributes to their average  energy expenditure in daily life. Simply put, the more you sit, the  less energy you expend. A study published in a 2008 issue of the  American Journal of Epidemiology reports that 55 percent of  Americans spend 7.7 hours in sedentary behavior daily.2  Fortunately, including only a small amount of low-level physical  activity benefits weight control. A study published in the June 2001  issue of the International Journal of Behavioral Nutritionand  Physical Activity reports that even breaking up sitting-time with  frequent but brief increased energy expenditure activities, such as  walking for five minutes every hour, helps maintain weight and even  aids in weight loss.3  Americans partake in an excessive amount of screen time, which  is a sedentary behavior that not only reduces energy expenditure,  but also contributes to weight gain because of the exposure to  aggressive advertising campaigns for unhealthy foods.  2.\\xa0Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al.

Vitamin A supplementation in these  deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who  contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the  diseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results  of these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the  World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations  Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns  against vitamin A deficiency.

Vitamin D Functions and Health Benefits  Vitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins derived from  cholesterol. Vitamins D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (calcitriol) are the  only ones known to have biological actions in the human body.  The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. In fact,  for most people, more than 90 percent of their vitamin D3 comes  from the casual exposure to the UVB rays in sunlight. Anything  that reduces your exposure to the sun’s UVB rays decreases the  amount of vitamin D3 your skin synthesizes. That would include  long winters, your home’s altitude, whether you are wearing  sunscreen, and the color of your skin (including tanned skin). Do you  ever wonder about an increased risk for skin cancer by spending too  much time in the sun? Do not fret. Less than thirty minutes of sun  exposure to the arms and legs will increase blood levels of vitamin  D3 more than orally taking 10,000 IU (250 micrograms) of vitamin  D3.

In the absence of an adequate  intake of vitamin D, less than 15 percent of calcium is absorbed  from foods or supplements. The effects of calcitriol on calcium  homeostasis are critical for bone health. A deficiency of vitamin  D in children causes the bone disease nutritional rickets. Rickets  is very common among children in developing countries and is  characterized by soft, weak, deformed bones that are exceptionally  susceptible to fracture. In adults, vitamin D deficiency causes a  similar disease called osteomalacia, which is characterized by low  BMD. Osteomalacia has the same symptoms and consequences as  osteoporosis and often coexists with osteoporosis. Vitamin D  deficiency is common, especially in the elderly population, dark- skinned populations, and in the many people who live in the  northern latitudes where sunlight exposure is much decreased  during the long winter season.

Updated February 11,  2016. Accessed October 22, 2017.  Niacin (B3)  Niacin is a component of the coenzymes NADH and NADPH, which  are involved in the catabolism and/or anabolism of carbohydrates,  lipids, and proteins. NADH is the predominant electron carrier and  transfers electrons to the electron-transport chain to make ATP.  NADPH is also required for the anabolic pathways of fatty-acid  and cholesterol synthesis. In contrast to other vitamins, niacin can  be synthesized by humans from the amino acid tryptophan in an  anabolic process requiring enzymes dependent on riboflavin,  vitamin B6, and iron. Niacin is made from tryptophan only after  tryptophan has met all of its other needs in the body. The  contribution of tryptophan-derived niacin to niacin needs in the  body varies widely and a few scientific studies have demonstrated  that diets high in tryptophan have very little effect on niacin  deficiency. Niacin deficiency is commonly known as pellagra and  the symptoms include fatigue, decreased appetite, and indigestion.  \\xa0These symptoms are then commonly followed by the four D’s:  diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and sometimes death.

For  example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of  free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader  (such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as  hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is  thus neutralized. Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide  acts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites,  meaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut.  Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as  well. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide,  which is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive  oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free  radicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with  proteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical  nitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a  chemical messenger in the brain.

They do so by being free radicals  themselves or by adding energy that provokes electrons to move  between atoms. Excessive exposure to environmental sources of  free radicals can contribute to disease by overwhelming the free  radical detoxifying systems and those processes involved in  repairing oxidative damage.  Oxidative Stress  Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ  between the amount of free radicals and the capabilities of the  detoxifying and repair systems. Sustained oxidative damage results  only under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and  repair systems are insufficient. Free radical-induced damage, when  left unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can  contribute to disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a  contributing factor to cancer, atherosclerosis (hardening of  arteries), arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease,  Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, emphysema,  and cataracts.  Aging is a process that is genetically determined but modulated  by factors in the environment. In the process of aging, tissue  function declines. The idea that oxidative stress is the primary  contributor to age-related tissue decline has been around for  decades, and it is true that tissues accumulate free radical-induced  damage as we age. Recent scientific evidence slightly modifies this  theory by suggesting oxidative stress is not the initial trigger for  age-related decline of tissues; it is suggested that the true culprit  is progressive dysfunction of metabolic processes, which leads to  increases in free radical production, thus influencing the stress  response of tissues as they age.  598  |  The Body’s Offense',\n",

Carotenoids are one type of phytochemical.  Phytochemicals also include indoles, lignans, phytoestrogens,  stanols,  saponins,  terpenes,  flavonoids,  carotenoids,  anthocyanidins, phenolic acids, and many more. They are found not  only in fruits and vegetables, but also in grains, seeds, nuts, and  legumes.  Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants, but they have several  other functions, such as mimicking hormones, altering absorption  of cholesterol, inhibiting inflammatory responses, and blocking the  actions of certain enzymes.  Phytochemicals are present in small amounts in the food supply,  and although thousands have been and are currently being  scientifically studied, their health benefits remain largely unknown.  Also largely unknown is their potential for toxicity, which could be  substantial if taken in large amounts in the form of supplements.  Moreover, phytochemicals often act in conjunction with each other  and with micronutrients. Thus, supplementing with only a few may  impair the functions of other phytochemicals or micronutrients.

Blood calcium  levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body  will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby  releasing stored calcium into the blood. \\xa0Thus, bone tissue sacrifices  its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels.

Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the  body like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium  function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that  when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling  process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the  osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium  phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium  salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue. When your  diet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases  causing it to become brittle and weak. Thus, increased calcium  intake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue.  Greater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD,  and to greater bone strength.

Dietary Sources of Calcium  In the typical American diet, calcium is obtained mostly from dairy  products, primarily cheese. A slice of cheddar or Swiss cheese  contains just over 200 milligrams of calcium. One cup of nonfat milk  contains approximately 300 milligrams of calcium, which is about  a third of the RDA for calcium for most adults.

The greatest positive influence on calcium absorption comes  from having an adequate intake of vitamin D. People deficient in  vitamin D absorb less than 15 percent of calcium from the foods they  eat. The hormone estrogen is another factor that enhances calcium  bioavailability. Thus, as a woman ages and goes through menopause,  during which estrogen levels fall, the amount of calcium absorbed  decreases and the risk for bone disease increases. Some fibers, such  as inulin, found in jicama, onions, and garlic, also promote calcium  intestinal uptake.  Chemicals that bind to calcium decrease its bioavailability. These  negative effectors of calcium absorption include the oxalates in  certain plants, the tannins in tea, phytates in nuts, seeds, and grains,  and some fibers. Oxalates are found in high concentrations in  spinach, parsley, cocoa, and beets. In general, the calcium  bioavailability is inversely correlated to the oxalate content in foods.  High-fiber, low-fat diets also decrease the amount of calcium  absorbed, an effect likely related to how fiber and fat influence  the amount of time food stays in the gut. Anything that causes  diarrhea, including sickness, medications, and certain symptoms  related to old age, decreases the transit time of calcium in the  gut and therefore decreases calcium absorption. As we get older,  stomach acidity sometimes decreases, diarrhea occurs more often,  kidney function is impaired, and vitamin D absorption and activation  is compromised, all of which contribute to a decrease in calcium  bioavailability.  \\xa0 Table 10.2 Calcium Content and Bioavailability of Various Foods  Calcium  |  627',\n",

Dietary Sources of Magnesium  Magnesium is part of the green pigment, chlorophyll, which is vital  for photosynthesis in plants; therefore green leafy vegetables are  a good dietary source for magnesium. Magnesium is also found in  high concentrations in fish, dairy products, meats, whole grains, and  nuts. Additionally chocolate, coffee, and hard water contain a good  amount of magnesium.

The iron in hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the capillaries of the  lungs and transports it to cells where the oxygen is released. If iron  level is low hemoglobin is not synthesized in sufficient amounts  and the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is reduced,  resulting in anemia. When iron levels are low in the diet the small  intestine more efficiently absorbs iron in an attempt to compensate  for the low dietary intake, but this process cannot make up for  the excessive loss of iron that occurs with chronic blood loss or  low intake. When blood cells are decommissioned for use, the body  recycles the iron back to the bone marrow where red blood cells  are made. The body stores some iron in the bone marrow, liver,  spleen, and skeletal muscle. A relatively small amount of iron is  excreted when cells lining the small intestine and skin cells die and  in blood loss, such as during menstrual bleeding. The lost iron must  be replaced from dietary sources.  The bioavailability of iron is highly dependent on dietary sources.  In animal-based foods about 60 percent of iron is bound to  hemoglobin, and heme iron is more bioavailable than nonheme iron.  The other 40 percent of iron in animal-based foods is nonheme,  which is the only iron source in plant-based foods. Some plants  contain chemicals (such as phytate, oxalates, tannins, and  polyphenols) that inhibit iron absorption.

Zinc  also is a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism. As the  result of its prominent roles in anabolic and energy metabolism, a  zinc deficiency in infants and children blunts growth. The reliance  of growth on adequate dietary zinc was discovered in the early  1960s in the Middle East where adolescent nutritional dwarfism was  linked to diets containing high amounts of phytate. Cereal grains  and some vegetables contain chemicals, one being phytate, which  blocks the absorption of zinc and other minerals in the gut. It is  estimated that half of the world’s population has a zinc-deficient  diet.1  This is largely a consequence of the lack of red meat and seafood  in the diet and reliance on cereal grains as the main dietary staple.  In adults, severe zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, diarrhea, skin  sores, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Zinc is a required cofactor  for an enzyme that synthesizes the heme portion of hemoglobin and  severely deficient zinc diets can result in anemia.  1.\\xa0Prasad, Ananda. (2003).

The other important function of  selenium is as an antioxidant.  Selenium Functions and Health Benefits  Around twenty-five known proteins require selenium to function.  Some are enzymes involved in detoxifying free radicals and include  glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase.

Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential  treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether  consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis  and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building  activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been  shown to increase BMD. In general, it appears that at low doses,  fluoride treatment increases BMD in people with osteoporosis and  is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of  calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug  Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of  osteoporosis mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known  and it has several side effects including frequent stomach upset and  joint pain.

The  DRI is not appropriate for people who are ill or malnourished, even  if they were healthy previously.  Determining Dietary Reference Intakes  Each DRI value is derived in a different way. See below for an  explanation of how each is determined:  1. Estimated Average Requirements. The EAR for a nutrient is  determined by a committee of nutrition experts who review  the scientific literature to determine a value that meets the  requirements of 50 percent of people in their target group  within a given life stage and for a particular sex. The  requirements of half of the group will fall below the EAR and  the other half will be above it. It is important to note that, for  each nutrient, a specific bodily function is chosen as the  criterion on which to base the EAR. For example, the EAR for  calcium is set using a criterion of maximizing bone health.

Once the EAR of a nutrient  has been established, the RDA can be mathematically  determined. While the EAR is set at a point that meets the  needs of half the population, RDA values are set to meet the  needs of the vast majority (97 to 98 percent) of the target  healthy population. It is important to note that RDAs are not  the same thing as individual nutritional requirements. The  actual nutrient needs of a given individual will be different  than the RDA. However, since we know that 97 to 98 percent of  the population’s needs are met by the RDA, we can assume that  if a person is consuming the RDA of a given nutrient, they are  most likely meeting their nutritional need for that nutrient.  The important thing to remember is that the RDA is meant as a  recommendation and meeting the RDA means it is very likely  that you are meeting your actual requirement for that nutrient.  Understanding the Difference  There is a distinct difference between a requirement and a  recommendation. For instance, the DRI for vitamin D is a  recommended 600 international units each day. However, in order  to find out your true personal requirements for vitamin D, a blood  test is necessary. The blood test will provide an accurate reading  from which a medical professional can gauge your required daily  vitamin D amounts. This may be considerably more or less than the  DRI, depending on what your level actually is.  1. Adequate Intake. AIs are created for nutrients when there is  insufficient consistent scientific evidence to set an EAR for the  entire population. As with RDAs, AIs can be used as nutrient- intake goals for a given nutrient. For example, there has not  712  |  Understanding Dietary Reference Intakes',\n",

All other values listed thereafter, from the calories to the  dietary fiber, are based on this one serving. On the panel, the  serving size is followed by the number of calories and then a list  of selected nutrients. You will also see “Percent Daily Value” on the  far right-hand side. This helps you determine if the food is a good  source of a particular nutrient or not.  The Daily Value (DV) represents the recommended amount of  a given nutrient based on the RDA of that nutrient in a  2,000-kilocalorie diet. The DV was updated as part of the new  nutrition facts label announced in May 2016. The updated DV applies  to packaged food, beverages and dietary supplements that contain  ingredients with a DV.\\xa0The percentage of Daily Value (percent DV)  represents the proportion of the total daily recommended amount  that you will get from one serving of the food. For example, in the  older food label in Figure 12.2 “Reading the Older Nutrition Label,”  the percent DV of calcium for one serving of macaroni-and-cheese  is 20 percent, which means that one serving of macaroni and cheese  provides 20 percent of the daily recommended calcium intake. Since  the DV for calcium is 1,300 milligrams, the food producer  determined the percent DV for calcium by taking the calcium  content in milligrams in each serving, and dividing it by 1,300  milligrams, and then multiplying it by 100 to get it into percentage  format. Whether you consume 2,000 calories per day or not you can  still use the percent DV as a target reference.  Generally, a percent DV of 5 is considered low and a percent  DV of 20 is considered high. This means, as a general rule, for fat,  saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium, look for foods with  a low percent DV. Alternatively, when concentrating on essential  mineral or vitamin intake, look for a high percent DV. To figure  out your fat allowance remaining for the day after consuming one  serving of macaroni-and-cheese, look at the percent DV for fat,  which is 18 percent, and subtract it from 100 percent. To know this  amount in grams of fat, read the footnote of the food label to find  that the recommended maximum amount of fat grams to consume  720  |  Discovering Nutrition Facts',\n",

Unless you  are buying the individual serving packages, chances are the bag you  picked up is at least eight servings, if not more.  According to the 2010 health and diet survey released by the FDA,  54 percent of first-time buyers of a product will check the food  label and will use this information to evaluate fat, calorie, vitamin,  and sodium content2.

Vary your choices to get the  benefit of as many different vegetables and fruits as you can. You  may choose to drink fruit juice as a replacement for eating fruit. (As  long as the juice is 100 percent fruit juice and only half your fruit  intake is replaced with juice, this is an acceptable exchange.) For  snacks, eat fruits, vegetables, or unsalted nuts.  Fill a quarter of your plate with whole grains such as 100 percent  whole-grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, and pasta. Half of your  daily grain intake should be whole grains. Read the ingredients list  on food labels carefully to determine if a food is comprised of whole  grains.  Select a variety of protein foods to improve nutrient intake and  promote health benefits. Each week, be sure to include a nice array  of protein sources in your diet, such as nuts, seeds, beans, legumes,  poultry, soy, and seafood. The recommended consumption amount  for seafood for adults is two 4-ounce servings per week. When  choosing meat, select lean cuts. Be conscious to prepare meats  using little or no added saturated fat, such as butter.  If you enjoy drinking milk or eating milk products, such as cheese  and yogurt, choose low-fat or nonfat products. Low-fat and nonfat  products contain the same amount of calcium and other essential  nutrients as whole-milk products, but with much less fat and  calories. Calcium, an important mineral for your body, is also  available in lactose-free and fortified soy beverage and rice  beverage products. You can also get calcium in vegetables and other  fortified foods and beverages.  Oils are essential for your diet as they contain valuable essential  fatty acids, but the type you choose and the amount you consume  is important. Be sure the oil is plant-based rather than based on  animal fat. You can also get oils from many types of fish, as well as  avocados, and unsalted nuts and seeds.

According to this  study, the largest single contributor to fruit intake was orange juice,  and potatoes were the dominant vegetable.  The USDA recommends that you fill half your plate with fruits  and vegetables. The number of servings of fruits and vegetables  that a person should consume every day is dependent on age, sex,  and level of physical activity. For example, a forty-year-old male  who exercises for sixty minutes per day should consume 2 cups of  fruit and 3½ cups of vegetables, while a fifteen-year-old female who  exercises for thirty minutes per day should consume 1½ cups of fruit  and 2½ cups of vegetables.

Therefore, it is crucial to  make careful dietary choices.  The Early Days of Pregnancy  For medical purposes, pregnancy is measured from the first day of  a woman’s last menstrual period until childbirth, and typically lasts  about forty weeks. Major changes begin to occur in the earliest  days, often weeks before a woman even knows that she is pregnant.  During this period, adequate nutrition supports cell division, tissue  differentiation, and organ development. As each week passes, new  milestones are reached. Therefore, women who are trying to  conceive should make proper dietary choices to ensure the delivery  of a healthy baby. Fathers-to-be should also consider their eating  habits. A sedentary lifestyle and a diet low in fresh fruits and  vegetables may affect male fertility. Men who drink too much  alcohol may also damage the quantity and quality of their sperm.1.

Additionally, since 1998, food manufacturers  have been required to add folate to cereals and other  grain products.2  Weight Gain during Pregnancy  During pregnancy, a mother’s body changes in many ways. One  of the most notable and significant changes is weight gain. If a  pregnant woman does not gain enough weight, her unborn baby  will be at risk. Poor weight gain, especially in the second and third  trimesters, could result not only in low birth weight, but also infant  mortality and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, it is vital for a  pregnant woman to maintain a healthy amount of weight gain. Her  weight prior to pregnancy also has a major effect. Infant birth  weight is one of the best indicators of a baby’s future health.  Pregnant women of normal prepregnancy weight should gain  between 25 and 35 pounds in total through the entire pregnancy.

However, as the pregnancy progresses, a woman  must increase her caloric intake. According to the IOM, she should  consume an additional 340 calories per day during the second  trimester, and an additional 450 calories per day during the third  trimester. This is partly due to an increase in metabolism, which  occurs during pregnancy and contributes to increased energy  needs. A woman can easily meet these increased needs by  consuming more nutrient-dense foods.

In addition,  women who exercise during pregnancy report fewer discomforts  and may have an easier time losing excess weight after childbirth.  Brisk walking, swimming, or an aerobics class geared toward  expectant mothers are all great ways to get exercise during a  pregnancy. Healthy women who already participate in vigorous  activities before pregnancy, such as running, can continue doing so  during pregnancy provided they discuss an exercise plan with their  physicians.  However, pregnant women should avoid pastimes that could  cause injury, such as soccer, football, and other contact sports,  or activities that could lead to falls, such as horseback riding and  downhill skiing. It may be best for pregnant women not to  participate in certain sports, such as tennis, that require you to  jump or change direction quickly. Scuba diving should also be  avoided because it might result in the fetus developing  decompression sickness. This potentially fatal condition results  from a rapid decrease in pressure when a diver ascends too  quickly11.

New mothers usually find that their appetite and thirst is greater  than before pregnancy; it is recommended that they still focus on  nutrient-dense foods to nourish their body and replace their body’s  nutrient stores. A conservative rate of weight loss (1-2 pounds per  week) during lactation does not usually impact the quantity or  quality of breast milk, but maternal deficiencies in some nutrients  have been described during lactation. The nutrient content of  breastmilk does not change much based upon maternal diet for  most nutrients. The RDA for energy is 330 additional Calories during  the first six months of lactation and 400 additional Calories during  the second six months of lactation. The energy needed to support  breastfeeding comes from both increased intake and from stored  fat. For example, during the first six months after her baby is born,  the daily caloric cost for a lactating mother is 500 Calories, with  330 calories derived from increased intake and 170 Calories derived  from maternal fat stores. This helps explain why breastfeeding may  promote weight loss in new mothers.

       "  'text': 'Components of Breastmilk  Human breast milk not only provides adequate nutrition for infants,  it also helps to protect newborns from disease. In addition, breast  milk is rich in cholesterol, which is needed for brain development. It  is helpful to know the different types and components of breastmilk,  along with the nutrients they provide to enable an infant to survive  and thrive.  Colostrum is the milk produced immediately after birth, prior  to the start of mature milk production, and lasts for two to five  days after the arrival of the baby. Cells in the breast can begin to  secrete colostrum by mid-pregnancy. During the last trimester, the  alveoli (grape-like clusters of cells that produce milk) can become  swollen with colostrum. Colostrum is thicker than mature breast  milk, and is yellowish or creamy in color. This protein-rich liquid  fulfills an infant’s nutrient needs during those early days.

Often parents start their babies on soy formula  because they incorrectly assume that soy formula will reduce  allergies and other health problems, but this is not the case.\\xa0 Soy- based formulas are sometimes given to infants who develop  diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, colic, or abdominal pain, but more  often these babies are put on hydrolysate formula to address these  concerns. Hypoallergenic protein hydrolysate formulas are given  to infants who are allergic to cow’s milk and soy protein, or who  have trouble tolerating them. This type of formula uses hydrolyzed  protein, meaning that the protein is broken down into amino acids  and small peptides, which makes it easier to digest, and makes it less  likely to trigger gastrointestinal distress.  Preterm infant formulas are given to premature and low birth  weight infants, if breast milk is unavailable. Preterm infant formulas  have 24 calories per fluid ounce and are given until the infant  reaches a desired weight. These formulas are also higher in protein,  calcium, and phosphorus to meet the special needs of premature  infants.  Infant formula comes in three basic types:  1. Powder that requires mixing with water. This is the least  expensive type of formula.  2. Concentrates, which are liquids that must be diluted with  water. This type is slightly more expensive.  3. Ready-to-use liquids that can be poured directly into bottles.  This is the most expensive type of formula. However, it  requires no preparation. Ready-to-use formulas are used when  a safe and sanitary water supply is not available. Ready-to-use  formulas are also convenient for traveling.  Most babies need about 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body  weight each day. Therefore, the average infant consumes about 24  fluid ounces of breastmilk or formula per day, or one ounce per  hour.

Eating  solids before 6 months of age usually means drinking less breast  milk and is associated with more ear infections and respiratory  infections. If parents try to feed an infant who is too young or is not  ready, their tongue will push the food out; this is called an extrusion  reflex.

Newborn jaundice is more common in a breastfed baby and tends  to last a bit longer.

One is a lack of time. Parents and  other caregivers who are constantly on the go may find it difficult  to fit home-cooked meals into a busy schedule and may turn to  fast food and other conveniences that are quick and easy, but not  nutritionally sound. Another contributing factor is a lack of access  to fresh fruits and vegetables. This is a problem particularly in low- income neighborhoods where local stores and markets may not  stock fresh produce or may have limited options. Physical inactivity  is also a factor, as toddlers who live a sedentary lifestyle are more  likely to be overweight or obese. Another contributor is a lack of  breastfeeding support. Children who were breastfed as infants have  lower rates of obesity than children who were bottle-fed.  To prevent or address toddler obesity parents and caregivers can  do the following:  • Eat at the kitchen table instead of in front of a television to  monitor what and how much a child eats.  • Offer a child healthy portions. The size of a toddler’s fist is an  appropriate serving size.  • Plan time for physical activity, about sixty minutes or more per  day. Toddlers should have no more than sixty minutes of  sedentary activity, such as watching television, per day.

According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,  children between ages of two and five consume about 200 calories  of added sugar per day.9 Therefore, parents with toddlers should  avoid processed foods, such as snacks from vending machines, and  sugary beverages, such as soda. Parents also need to instruct a child  on brushing their teeth at this time to help a toddler develop healthy  habits and avoid tooth decay. Generally, children need help brushing  their teeth until they are 5 years old.  Iron-Deficiency Anemia  An infant who switches to solid foods, but does not eat enough  iron-rich foods, can develop iron-deficiency anemia. This condition  occurs when an iron-deprived body cannot produce enough  hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen  throughout the body. The inadequate supply of hemoglobin for new  blood cells results in anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a  number of problems including weakness, pale skin, shortness of  breath, and irritability. It can also result in intellectual, behavioral,  or motor problems. In infants and toddlers, iron-deficiency anemia  can occur as young children are weaned from iron-rich foods, such  as breast milk and iron-fortified formula. They begin to eat solid  foods that may not provide enough of this nutrient. As a result,  their iron stores become diminished at a time when this nutrient is  critical for brain growth and development.  \\xa0 9.\\xa0Ervin, R. B., Kit, B. K., Carroll, M. D., & Ogden, C. L.

In the United States, about 20 percent of households  with children are food insecure to some degree. In half of those,  only adults experience food insecurity, while in the other half both  adults and children are considered to be food insecure, which  means that children did not have access to adequate, nutritious  meals at times.3  Growing up in a food-insecure household can lead to a number  of problems. Deficiencies in iron, zinc, protein, and vitamin A can  result in stunted growth, illness, and limited development. Federal  programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, the School  Breakfast Program, and Summer Feeding Programs, work to address  the risk of hunger and malnutrition in school-aged children. They  help to fill the gaps and provide children living in food-insecure  households with greater access to nutritious meals.  The National School Lunch Program  Beginning with preschool, children consume at least one of their  meals in a school setting. Many children receive both breakfast and  lunch outside of the home. Therefore, it is important for schools  to provide meals that are nutritionally sound.

Recent studies show that three million children  under age eighteen are allergic to at least one type of food.6  Some of the most common allergenic foods include peanuts, milk,  eggs, soy, wheat, and shellfish. An allergy occurs when a protein  in food triggers an immune response, which results in the release  of antibodies, histamine, and other defenders that attack foreign  bodies. Possible symptoms include itchy skin, hives, abdominal pain,  vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. Symptoms usually develop within  minutes to hours after consuming a food allergen. Children can  outgrow a food allergy, especially allergies to wheat, milk, eggs, or  soy.  Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction that results in difficulty  breathing, swelling in the mouth and throat, decreased blood  pressure, shock, or even death. Milk, eggs, wheat, soybeans, fish,  shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts are the most likely to trigger this  type of response.

Symptoms of  lactose intolerance usually affect the GI tract and can include  bloating, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, and diarrhea. An intolerance  is best managed by making dietary changes and avoiding any foods  that trigger the reaction.8  The Threat of Lead Toxicity  There is a danger of lead toxicity, or lead poisoning, among school- aged children. Lead is found in plumbing in old homes, in lead-based  paint, and occasionally in the soil. Contaminated food and water can  increase exposure and result in hazardous lead levels in the blood.  Children under age six are especially vulnerable. They may consume  items tainted with lead, such as chipped, lead-based paint. Another  common exposure is lead dust in carpets, with the dust flaking off  of paint on walls. When children play or roll around on carpets  coated with lead, they are in jeopardy. Lead is indestructible, and  once it has been ingested it is difficult for the human body to alter  or remove it. It can quietly build up in the body for months, or even  years, before the onset of symptoms.

The extra energy required for physical development  during the teenaged years should be obtained from foods that  provide nutrients instead of “empty calories.” Also, teens who  participate in sports must make sure to meet their increased energy  needs.  Older adolescents are more responsible for their dietary choices  than younger children, but parents and caregivers must make sure  that  teens  continue  to  meet  their  nutrient  needs.  For  carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories  (203–293 grams for 1,800 daily calories). Adolescents require more  servings of grain than younger children, and should eat whole  grains, such as wheat, oats, barley, and brown rice. The Institute of  Medicine recommends higher intakes of protein for growth in the  adolescent population. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30 percent  of daily calories (45–135 grams for 1,800 daily calories), and lean  proteins, such as meat, poultry, fish, beans, nuts, and seeds are  excellent ways to meet those nutritional needs.

Eating disorders involve extreme behavior related to food and  exercise. Sometimes referred to as “starving or stuffing,” they  encompass a group of conditions marked by under eating or  overeating. Some of these conditions include:  • Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is a potentially fatal  condition characterized by under eating and excessive weight  loss. People with this disorder are preoccupied with dieting,  calories, and food intake to an unhealthy degree. Anorexics  have a poor body image, which leads to anxiety, avoidance of  food, a rigid exercise regimen, fasting, and a denial of hunger.  The condition predominantly affects females. Between 0.5 and  1 percent of American women and girls suffer from this eating  disorder.  • Binge-Eating Disorder. People who suffer from binge-eating  disorder experience regular episodes of eating an extremely  large amount of food in a short period of time. Binge eating is a  compulsive behavior, and people who suffer from it typically  feel it is beyond their control.

Rapid weight loss is  not recommended for preteens or younger children due to the risk  of deficiencies and stunted growth.  Avoiding Added Sugars  One major contributing factor to childhood obesity is the  consumption of added sugars. Added sugars include not only sugar  added to food at the table, but also are ingredients in items such as  bread, cookies, cakes, pies, jams, and soft drinks. The added sugar  in store-bought items may be listed as white sugar, brown sugar,  high-fructose corn syrup, honey, malt syrup, maple syrup, molasses,  anhydrous dextrose, crystal dextrose, and concentrated fruit juice.  (Not included are sugars that occur naturally in foods, such as the  lactose in milk or the fructose in fruits.) In addition, sugars are  often “hidden” in items added to foods after they’re prepared, such  as ketchup, salad dressing, and other condiments.

They begin the process of  menopause, typically in their late forties or early fifties. The ovaries  slowly cease to produce estrogen and progesterone, which results  in the end of menstruation. Menopausal symptoms can vary, but  often include hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes. The  hormonal changes that occur during menopause can lead to a  number of physiological changes as well, including alterations in  body composition, such as weight gain in the abdominal area. Bone  loss is another common condition related to menopause due to  the loss of female reproductive hormones. Bone thinning increases  the risk of fractures, which can affect mobility and the ability to  complete everyday tasks, such as cooking, bathing, and dressing.6  Recommendations for women experiencing menopause or  perimenopause (the stage just prior to the end of the menstruation)  include:  • consuming a variety of whole grains, and other nutrient-dense  foods  • maintaining a diet high in fiber, low in fat, and low in sodium  • avoiding caffeine, spicy foods, and alcohol to help prevent hot  flashes  • eating foods rich in calcium, or taking physician-prescribed  calcium supplements and vitamin D  • doing stretching exercises to improve balance and flexibility  6.\\xa0Eating Right During Menopause.Academy of Nutrition  and Dietetics. http:/ /www.eatright.org/Public/ content.aspx?id=6809.

A condition known as the  anorexia of aging is characterized by poor food intake, which results  in dangerous weight loss. This major health problem among the  elderly leads to a higher risk for immune deficiency, frequent falls,  muscle loss, and cognitive deficits. Reduced muscle mass and  physical activity mean that older adults need fewer calories per  day to maintain a normal weight. It is important for health care  providers to examine the causes for anorexia of aging among their  patients, which can vary from one individual to another.  Understanding why some elderly people eat less as they age can  help healthcare professionals assess the risk factors associated with  this condition. Decreased intake may be due to disability or the lack  of a motivation to eat. Also, many older adults skip at least one meal  each day. As a result, some elderly people are unable to meet even  reduced energy needs.  Nutritional interventions should focus primarily on a healthy diet.  Remedies can include increasing the frequency of meals and adding  healthy, high-calorie foods (such as nuts, potatoes, whole-grain  pasta, and avocados) to the diet. Liquid supplements between meals  may help to improve caloric intake.5 Health care professionals  should consider a patient’s habits and preferences when developing  a nutritional treatment plan.

The combination of increased energy  output, energy expenditure and basal needs over a long period of  time can have a major impact on total energy expenditure (see  Figure 16.2 “The Effect of Physical Activity on Energy Expenditure”).  The more energy you expend, the more foods you are able to  consume while maintaining a healthy weight. Any improvement to  metabolic fitness is beneficial and means a decrease in the risk for  developing diabetes, or other chronic conditions.  One measurement of metabolic fitness is basal metabolic rate, or  BMR, which is a measurement of the amount of energy required for  the body to maintain its basic functions while at rest, i.e. breathing,  heart beats, liver and kidney function, and so on. On average, BMR  accounts for between 50 and 70 percent of a person’s total daily  energy expenditure. Different factors can affect the BMR. For  example, a slender person who is tall has more body surface area  and therefore has a higher RMR relative to their body mass (weight).  Also, muscle utilizes more energy at rest than fat, so a person with  more muscle mass has a higher BMR.  A second measurement of metabolic fitness is the number of  calories burned during physical activity. The amount of calories  burned depends on how much oxygen is delivered to tissues, and  how efficiently metabolic reactions consume oxygen and, therefore,  expend calories. One of the best estimates of energy expenditure  during exercise is how much oxygen a person consumes. Recall that  VO2 max is a measure of the maximum cardiorespiratory capacity  to deliver oxygen to the body, especially to working muscles during  exercise.. Greater VO2 max is indicative of better cardiovascular  fitness. In contrast to RMR, VO2 max increases significantly with  exercise training due to training adaptations that increase the  body’s ability to deliver oxygen to working tissues and an increased  capacity of muscles to take up and utilize oxygen.

Fatty  acids are transported from fat-storing cells to the muscle to rectify  the nutrient deficit. However, fatty acids take more time to convert  to energy than glucose, thus decreasing performance levels. To  avoid “hitting the wall” or “bonking,” endurance athletes load up  on carbohydrates for a few days before the event, known as  carbohydrate loading. This will maximize an athlete’s amount of  glycogen stored in their liver and muscle tissues. It is important not  to assume that carbohydrate loading works for everyone. Without  accompanied endurance training you will not increase the amount  of stored glucose. If you plan on running a five-mile race for fun  with your friend and decide to eat a large amount of carbohydrates  in the form of a big spaghetti dinner the night before, the excess  carbohydrates will be stored as fat. Therefore, if you are not an  endurance athlete exercising for more than 90 minutes,  carbohydrate loading will provide no benefit, and can even have  some disadvantages.

Athletes have different nutritional needs to  support the vigorous level they compete and practice at.  Energy Needs  To determine an athletes nutritional needs, it is important to revisit  the concept of energy metabolism. Energy intake is the foundation  of an athlete’s diet because it supports optimal body functions,  determines the amount of intake of macronutrients and  micronutrients, and assists in the maintaining of body composition.  Energy needs for athletes increase depending on their energy  expenditure. The energy expended during physical activity are  contingent on the intensity, duration, and frequency of the exercise.

Its intended audience are students from the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa enrolled in the Food Science and Human Nutrition (FSHN) 185 course, The Science of Human Nutrition. However, this open access textbook may be of interest to other courses interested in teaching nutrition through a Hawai‘i- Pacific framed lens.

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'Macronutrients Nutrients that are needed in large amounts are called macronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk, fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and complex carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that circulates in your blood. Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can be unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks Introduction | 5',\n",

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down. One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates. Lipids Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.',\n",

The three main types of lipids are triglycerides (triacylglycerols), phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes, surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other functions in the body. 6 | Introduction',\n",

Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific proteins.

On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions).

There are five key factors that make up a healthful diet: 1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of each essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories. 2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts of all nutrients. 3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you get from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of energy you expend during your day’s activities. 4.

As an alternative to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh whole foods that have been sustaining people for generations. Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health. Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses.

Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of “empty-calorie” foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which are also called “nutrient-poor.”Nutrient-dense foods include fruits and vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate weight loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients. Balance Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example, calcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are good sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to get the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a proper balance between food choices is critical.

Special attention are given to organs such as skin, eyes, tongue, ears, mouth, hair, nails, and gums. Clinical methods of assessing nutritional status involve checking signs of deficiency at specific places on the body or asking the patient whether they have any symptoms that might suggest nutrient deficiency. Dietary methods of assessing nutritional status Dietary methods of assessment include looking at past or current intakes of nutrients from food by individuals or a group to determine their nutritional status.

Unfortunately, not all scientific conclusions are developed in the interest of human health, and some can be biased. Therefore, it is important to know where a scientific study was conducted and who provided the funding, as this can have an impact on the scientific conclusions being made. For example, an air quality study paid for by a tobacco company diminishes its value in the minds of readers as well as a red meat study performed at a laboratory funded by a national beef association. Nutritional Science Evolution One of the newest areas in the realm of nutritional science is the scientific discipline of nutritional genetics, also called nutrigenomics. Genes are part of DNA and contain the genetic information that make up all of our traits. Genes are codes for proteins and when they are turned “on” or “off,” they change how the body works. While we know that health is defined as more than just the absence of disease, there are currently very few accurate genetic markers of good health.

A famous quote by the Greek physician Hippocrates over two thousand years ago, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” bear much relevance on our food choices and their connection to our health. Today, the scientific community echoes Hippocrates’ statement as it recognizes some foods as functional foods. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics defines functional foods as “whole foods and fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods that have a potentially beneficial effect on health when consumed as part of a varied diet on a regular basis, at effective levels.” In the latter nineteenth century, a Russian doctor of immunology, Elie Metchnikoff, was intrigued by the healthy life spans of people who lived in the tribes of the northern Caucasus Mountains. What contributed to their long lifespan and their resistance to life- threatening diseases?A possible factor lay wrapped up in a leather satchel used to hold fermented milk. Observing the connection between the beverage and longevity, Dr. Elie Metchnikoff began his research on beneficial bacteria and the longevity of life that led to his book, The Prolongation of Life.

Aside from poi’s nutrient dense composition, fermented poi has numerous compounds created in the fermentation process that are very beneficial to the health of the human body. As a probiotic, evidence suggests that poi can be useful in helping diseases such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer.1 Another well-known probiotic to the local people of Hawai‘i is Kimchi.

When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your brain that it is time to eat. Sights and smells influence your body’s preparedness for food. Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed and taken into the body. To do this, the digestive system functions on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and chemically to break down large molecules. The smaller nutrient molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout the body for energy\\xa0 or used as building blocks for new cells. The digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus. It is lined with mucosal tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through the tract).',\n",

The first step is ingestion, which is the intake of food into the digestive tract. It may seem a simple process, but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry. In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. The chemical breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller components. Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the mouth. Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva provides lubrication and enables food movement downward. The slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which moves down the digestive tract as you swallow. Swallowing may seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this, swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped 72 | The Digestive System',\n",

As you swallow, the bolus is pushed from the mouth through the pharynx and into a muscular tube called the esophagus. As the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the epiglottis closes to prevent choking by keeping food from going into the trachea. Peristaltic contractions also known as peristalsis in the esophagus propel the food bolus down to the stomach (Figure 3.6 “Peristalsis in the Esophagus”). At the junction between the esophagus and stomach there is a sphincter muscle that remains closed until the food bolus approaches. The pressure of the food bolus stimulates the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and open and food then moves from the esophagus into the stomach. The mechanical breakdown of food is accentuated by the muscular contractions of the stomach and small intestine that mash, mix, slosh, and propel food down the alimentary canal. Solid food takes between four and eight seconds to travel down the esophagus, and liquids take about one second. Figure 2.6 Peristalsis in the Esophagus The Digestive System | 73',\n",

These gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food. The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates. It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach contents completely into the small intestine. The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in digestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day.

A main task of the large intestine is to absorb much of the remaining water. Remember, water is present not only in solid foods and beverages, but also the stomach releases a few hundred milliliters of gastric juice, and the pancreas adds approximately 500 milliliters during the digestion of the meal. For the body to conserve water, it is important that excessive water is not lost in fecal matter. In the large intestine, no further chemical or mechanical breakdown of food takes place unless it is accomplished by the bacteria that inhabit this portion of the intestinal tract.

Neurons form the core of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and other nerve bundles in the body. The main function of the central nervous system is to sense changes in the external environment and create a reaction to them. For instance, if your finger comes into contact with a thorn on a rose bush, a sensory neuron transmits a signal from your finger up through the spinal cord and into the brain. Another neuron in the brain sends a signal that travels back to the muscles in your hand and stimulates muscles to contract and you jerk your finger away. All of this happens within a tenth of a second. All nerve impulses travel by the movement of charged sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride atoms. Nerves communicate with each other via chemicals built from amino acids called neurotransmitters. Eating adequate protein from a variety of sources will ensure the body gets all of the different amino acids that are important for central nervous system function.

Just as too much glucose is bad for other organs, such as the kidneys and pancreas, it also produces negative effects upon the brain. Excessive glucose levels in the blood can cause a loss of cognitive function, and chronically high blood-glucose levels can damage brain cells. The brain’s cognitive functions include language processing, learning, perceiving, and thinking. Recent scientific studies demonstrate that having continuously high blood- glucose levels substantially elevates the risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, which is the greatest cause of age-related cognitive decline. The good news is that much research is directed toward determining the best diets and foods that slow cognitive decline and maximize brain health. A study in the June 2010 issue of the Archives of Neurology reports that people over age 65 who adhered to diets that consisted of higher intakes of nuts, fish, poultry, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, fruits, salad dressing, and dark green, and leafy vegetables, as well as a lower intake of high-fat dairy products, red meat, organ meat, and butter, had a much reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease.1 Other scientific studies provide supporting evidence that foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants provide the brain with protection against Alzheimer’s disease. One potential “brain food” is the blueberry.

For oxidative phosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may be surprised to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The cardiovascular system transports gases from the lungs to tissues throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in labored breathing and other difficulties. The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration, remove the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base balance.

When cells are resistant to insulin they do not take up enough glucose and fatty acids, so glucose and fatty acids remain at high concentrations in the blood.

Muscle contraction relies on energy delivery to the muscle. Each movement uses up cellular energy, and without an adequate energy supply, muscle function suffers. Muscle, like the liver, can store the energy from glucose in the large polymeric molecule glycogen. But unlike the liver, muscles use up all of their own stored energy and do not export it to other organs in the body.

In the process of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built up at a different site. In adulthood, our bones stop growing and modeling, but continue to go through a process of bone remodeling. In the process of remodeling, bone tissue is degraded and built up at the same location. About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting upon them, even in adulthood.

The major physical factors contributing to body weight are water weight, muscle tissue mass, bone tissue mass, and fat tissue mass. Overweight refers to having more weight than normal for a particular height and may be the result of water weight, muscle weight, or fat mass. Obese refers specifically to having excess body fat. In most cases people who are overweight also have excessive body fat and therefore body weight is an indicator of obesity in much of the population. The “ideal” healthy body weight for a particular person is dependent on many things, such as frame size, sex, muscle mass, bone density, age, and height. The perception of the “ideal” body weight is additionally dependent on cultural factors and the mainstream societal advertisement of beauty. To standardize the “ideal” body weight and relate it to health, scientists have devised mathematical formulas to better define a healthy weight. These mathematically derived measurements are used by health professionals to correlate disease risk with populations of people and at the individual level. A clinician will take two measurements, one of weight and one of fat mass, in order to diagnose obesity.',\n",

BMI Limitations A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass. Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis, even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass. BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.',\n",

Having more fat mass may be indicative of disease risk, but fat mass also varies with sex, age, and physical activity level. Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction and, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones. The optimal fat content of a female is between 20 and 30 percent of her total weight and for a male is between 12 and 20 percent. Fat mass can be measured in a variety of ways. The simplest and lowest- cost way is the skin-fold test. A health professional uses a caliper to measure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of the body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness. It is a noninvasive and fairly accurate method of measuring fat mass, but similar to BMI, is compared to standards of mostly young to middle- aged adults.',\n",

Fluid compartments are separated by selectively permeable membranes, which allow some things, such as water, to move through while other substances require special transport proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water between fluid compartments happens by osmosis, which is simply the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it is not so concentrated. Water is never transported actively; that is, it never takes energy for water to move between compartments. Although cells do not directly control water movement, they do control movement of electrolytes and other solutes and thus indirectly regulate water movement by controlling where there will be regions of high and low concentrations. Cells maintain their water volume at a constant level, but the composition of solutes in a cell is in a continuous state of flux. This is because cells are bringing nutrients in, metabolizing them, and disposing of waste products.

Molecules of water (H2O) surround substances, suspending them in a sea of water molecules. The solvent action of water allows for substances to be more readily transported.

The concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water. (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration of all dissolved substances is equal.) The force driving the water movement through the selectively permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an equal rate). One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different volumes is the following 5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L = 5g/L) The differences in concentrations of particular substances provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.',\n",

In fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200 milligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium. Kidney reabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a relatively constant sodium concentration in the blood. Other Functions of Sodium in the Body The second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse transmission. Nerve impulse transmission results from the transport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge difference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular environment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium current moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction also involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion movements. Sodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine and also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney. Amino acids, glucose and water must make their way from the small intestine to the blood.',\n",

Sweat is mostly water but also contains some electrolytes, mostly sodium and chloride. Under normal environmental conditions (i.e., not hot, humid days) water and sodium loss through sweat is negligible, but is highly variable among individuals. It is estimated that sixty minutes of high-intensity physical activity, like playing a game of tennis, can produce approximately one liter of sweat; however the amount of sweat produced is highly dependent on environmental conditions. A liter of sweat typically contains between 1 and 2 grams of sodium and therefore exercising for multiple hours can result in a high amount of sodium loss in some people. Additionally, hard labor can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case, the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal. In athletes hyponatremia, or a low blood-sodium level, is not so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia.',\n",

The American College of Sports Medicine suggests if you are exercising for longer than one hour you eat one high carbohydrate (25–40 grams) per hour of exercise along with ample water.1 Watch out for the fat content, as sometimes energy bars contain a hefty dose.

The IOM estimates that greater than 95 percent of men and 75 percent of women in America consume salt in excess of the UL. Many scientific studies demonstrate that reducing salt intake prevents hypertension, is helpful in reducing blood pressure after hypertension is diagnosed, and reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease. The IOM recommends that people over fifty, African Americans, diabetics, and those with chronic kidney disease should consume no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that all Americans, not just those listed, should consume less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day to prevent cardiovascular disease.

As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more potassium is excreted.

The signs and symptoms of hypokalemia are related to the functions of potassium in nerve cells and consequently skeletal and smooth-muscle contraction. The signs and symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps, respiratory distress, and constipation. Severe potassium depletion can cause the heart to have abnormal contractions and can even be fatal. High levels of potassium in the blood, or hyperkalemia, also affects the heart. It is a silent condition as it often displays no signs or symptoms. Extremely high levels of potassium in the blood disrupt the electrical impulses that stimulate the heart and can cause the heart to stop. Hyperkalemia is usually the result of kidney dysfunction.

Excessive water intake can dilute the levels of critical electrolytes in the blood. Water intoxication is rare, however when it does happen, it can be deadly. On the other hand, having too little water in the body is common. In fact, diarrhea-induced dehydration is the number-one cause of early-childhood death worldwide. In this section we will discuss subtle changes in electrolytes that compromise health on a chronic basis. High-Hydration Status: Water Intoxication/ Hyponatremia Water intoxication mainly affects athletes who overhydrate. Water intoxication is extremely rare, primarily because healthy kidneys are capable of excreting up to one liter of excess water per hour. Overhydration was unfortunately demonstrated in 2007 by Jennifer Strange, who drank six liters of water in three hours while competing in a “Hold Your Wee for a Wii” radio contest.

Dehydration can be caused by prolonged physical activity without adequate water intake, heat exposure, excessive weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, blood loss, infectious diseases, malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and very high glucose levels. Physiologically, dehydration decreases blood volume. The water in cells moves into the blood to compensate for the low blood-volume, and cells shrink. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include thirst, dizziness, fainting, headaches, low blood-pressure, fatigue, low to no urine output, and, in extreme cases, loss of consciousness and death. Signs and symptoms are usually noticeable after about 2 percent of total body water is lost. Chronic dehydration is linked to higher incidences of some diseases. There is strong evidence that low-hydration status increases the risk for kidney stones and exercise-induced asthma. There is also some scientific evidence that chronic dehydration increases the risk for kidney disease, heart disease, and the development of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes.',\n",

The effect on blood pressure was greatest in participants with hypertension at the beginning of the study who followed the DASH diet. Their systolic blood pressures were, on average, 11.5 mmHg lower than participants with hypertension on the control diet.6 Following the DASH diet not only reduces sodium intake, but also increases potassium, calcium, and magnesium intake.

About 15 percent of Americans obtain drinking water from private wells, which are not subject to EPA standards. Producing water safe for drinking involves some or all of the following processes: screening out large objects, removing excess calcium carbonate from hard water sources, flocculation, which adds a precipitating agent to remove solid particles, clarification, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. These processes aim to remove unhealthy substances and produce high-quality, colorless, odorless, good-tasting water. Most drinking water is disinfected by the process of chlorination, which involves adding chlorine compounds to the water. Chlorination is cheap and effective at killing bacteria. However, it is less effective at removing protozoa, such as Giardia lamblia. Chlorine-resistant protozoa and viruses are instead removed by extensive filtration methods. In the decades immediately following the implementation of water chlorination and disinfection methods in this country, waterborne illnesses, such as cholera and typhoid fever, essentially disappeared in the United States (Figure 3.12 “Deadly Water-borne Illnesses In United States”).',\n",

How does caffeine stimulate the brain?Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep. At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia.',\n",

Although the effect of caffeine on calcium excretion is small, postmenopausal women with risk factors for osteoporosis may want to make sure their dietary caffeine intake is low or moderate and not excessive. The Caffeine Myth A diuretic refers to any substance that elevates the normal urine output above that of drinking water. Caffeinated beverages are commonly believed to be dehydrating due to their diuretic effect, but results from scientific studies do not support that caffeinated beverages increase urine output more so than water. This does not mean that consuming caffeinated beverages does not affect urine output, but rather that it does not increase urine output more than water does. Thus, caffeinated beverages are considered a source of hydration similar to water.

The American College of Sports Medicine states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance. The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.

This is NOT recommended, as water intoxication not only compromises performance, but may also be deadly.

Children and adult athletes exercising for more than one hour at high-intensity (tennis, rowing, rugby, soccer, etc.)may benefit endurance-wise and possibly performance-wise from consuming a sports drink rather than water. However, consuming sports drinks provides no benefit over water to endurance, performance, or exercise recovery for those exercising less than an hour. In fact, as with all other sugary drinks containing few to no nutrients, they are only another source of calories. Drinking sports drinks when you are doing no exercise at all is not recommended. Sports Drink Alternatives Instead of a sports drink, you can replenish lost fluids and obtain energy and electrolytes during exercise by drinking plain water and eating a sports bar or snack that contains carbohydrates, protein, and electrolytes. Post-exercise, low-fat milk has been scientifically shown to be just as effective as a sports drink as a rehydration beverage and it is more nutrient-dense, containing carbohydrates, protein, and electrolytes, in addition to other vitamins. The Bottom Line Sports drinks consumed in excess by athletes or used by non- athletes simply are another source of added sugars, and thus extra calories, in the diet and provide no performance, exercise recovery or health benefit. 224 | Popular Beverage Choices',\n",

Amylose, a plant starch, is a linear chain containing hundreds of glucose units. Amylopectin, another plant starch, is a branched chain containing thousands of glucose units. These large starch molecules form crystals and are the energy-storing molecules of plants. These two starch molecules (amylose and amylopectin) are contained together in foods, but the smaller one, amylose, is less abundant. Eating raw foods containing starches provides very little energy as the digestive system has a hard time breaking them down.

Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness.

Energy Production The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells in the body. Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus other compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The brain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because it uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under extreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose entering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back into the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy remove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their membranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical bonds between the carbon atoms.

Prolonged muscle use (such as exercise for longer than a few hours) can deplete the glycogen energy reserve. Remember that this is referred to as “hitting the wall” or “bonking” and is characterized by fatigue and a decrease in exercise performance. The weakening of muscles sets in because it takes longer to transform the chemical energy in fatty acids and proteins to usable energy than glucose. After prolonged exercise, glycogen is gone and muscles must rely more on lipids and proteins as an energy source. Athletes can increase their glycogen reserve modestly by reducing training intensity and increasing their carbohydrate intake to between 60 and 70 percent of total calories three to five days prior to an event. People who are not hardcore training and choose to run a 5-kilometer race for fun do not need to consume a big plate of pasta prior to a race since without long-term intense training the adaptation of increased muscle glycogen will not happen. The liver, like muscle, can store glucose energy as a glycogen, but in contrast to muscle tissue it will sacrifice its stored glucose energy to other tissues in the body when blood glucose is low.

(Recall that sucrose, or table sugar, is a disaccharide consisting of one glucose unit and one fructose unit.)HFCS also contains the simple sugars fructose and glucose, but with fructose at a slightly higher concentration. In the production of HFCS, corn starch is broken down to glucose, and some of the glucose is then converted to fructose. Fructose is sweeter than glucose; hence many food manufacturers choose to sweeten foods with HFCS. HFCS is used as a sweetener for carbonated beverages, condiments, cereals, and a great variety of other processed foods. Some scientists, public health personnel, and healthcare providers believe that fructose is the cause of the obesity epidemic and its associated health consequences. The majority of their evidence stems from the observation that since the early 1970s the number of overweight or obese Americans has dramatically increased and so has the consumption of foods containing HFCS.

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and 65 percent of your total caloric daily intake. This means that on a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women, respectively.',\n",

It’s the Whole Nutrient Package In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks, cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie carbohydrates. They are sometimes referred to as ‘bad carbohydrates,’ as they are known to cause health problems when consumed in excess. Understanding Carbohydrates from Product Information While nutrition facts labels aid in determining the amount of carbohydrates you eat, they do not help in determining whether a food is refined or not. The ingredients list provides some help in this regard. It identifies all of the food’s ingredients in order of concentration, with the most concentrated ingredient first. When choosing between two breads, pick the one that lists whole wheat (not wheat flour) as the first ingredient, and avoid those with other flour ingredients, such as white flour or corn flour.

The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommends eating more unrefined carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing consumption of foods that are high in added sugars. To accomplish these recommendations use some or all of the following suggestions: • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of beans and/or nuts with dinner. • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown rice, or whole-wheat pasta. Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal listed as the first ingredient. • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour. • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a Kaiser roll or baguette.

The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk, coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods. Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses, and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as a glossy appearance and smooth texture.',\n",

The large doses (2.5 percent of diet) of saccharine caused a pellet to form in the rat’s bladder. That pellet chronically irritated the bladder wall, eventually resulting in tumor development. Since this study, scientific investigation in rats, monkeys, and humans have not found any relationship between saccharine consumption and bladder cancer. In 2000, saccharin was removed from the US National Toxicology Program’s list of potential carcinogens.1 There have been health concerns over other artificial sweeteners, most notably aspartame (sold under the trade names of NutraSweet and Equal).

Composed of fats and oils, lipids are molecules that yield high energy and have a chemical composition mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids perform three primary biological functions within the body: they serve as structural components of cell membranes, function as energy storehouses, and function as important signaling molecules. The three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols. Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids in the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil, butter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats.

Most of the energy required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates chapter, glucose is stored in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of energy, lipids primarily function as an energy reserve. As you may recall, glycogen is quite bulky with heavy water content, thus the body cannot store too much for long. Alternatively, fats are packed together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with energy—it contains more than double the amount of energy than a gram of carbohydrate. Energy is needed to power the muscles for all the physical work and play an average person or child engages in. For instance, the stored energy in muscles propels an athlete down the track, spurs a dancer’s legs to showcase the latest fancy steps, and keeps all the moving parts of the body functioning smoothly. Unlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost indefinitely in size.',\n",

For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories of energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of carbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity and on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person to person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the high-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing children require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth and development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for an extended period, growth and development will not progress normally.

If each available carbon bond holds a hydrogen atom we call this a saturated fatty acid chain. All carbon atoms in such a fatty acid chain are bonded with single bonds. Sometimes the chain has a place where hydrogen atoms are missing. This is referred to as the point of unsaturation. When one or more bonds between carbon atoms are a double bond (C=C), that fatty acid is called an unsaturated fatty acid, as it has one or more points of unsaturation.

If you decide to limit or redirect your intake of fat products, then choosing unsaturated fat is more beneficial than choosing a saturated fat. This choice is easy enough to make because unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature (for example, olive oil) whereas saturated fats tend to be solid at room temperature (for example, butter). Avocados are rich in unsaturated fats. Most vegetable and fish oils contain high quantities of polyunsaturated fats.',\n",

When the hydrogen atoms are bonded to the same side of the carbon chain, it is called a cis fatty acid. Because the hydrogen atoms are on the same side, the carbon chain has a bent structure. Naturally occurring fatty acids usually have a cis configuration. In a trans fatty acid, the hydrogen atoms are attached on opposite sides of the carbon chain. Unlike cis fatty acids, most trans fatty acids are not found naturally in foods, but are a result of a process called hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is the process of adding hydrogen to the carbon double bonds, thus making the fatty acid saturated (or less unsaturated, in the case of partial hydrogenation). This is how vegetable oils are converted into semisolid fats for use in the manufacturing process.

From the Mouth to the Stomach The first step in the digestion of triglycerides and phospholipids begins in the mouth as lipids encounter saliva. Next, the physical action of chewing coupled with the action of emulsifiers enables the digestive enzymes to do their tasks. The enzyme lingual lipase, along with a small amount of phospholipid as an emulsifier, initiates the process of digestion.

An LDL level of less than 100 milligrams per deciliter is ideal while an LDL level above 160 mg/dL would be considered high. In contrast, a low value of HDL is a telltale sign that a person is living with major risks for disease. Values of less than 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/ dL for women mark a risk factor for developing heart disease. In short, elevated LDL blood lipid profiles indicate an increased risk of heart attack, while elevated HDL blood lipid profiles indicate a reduced risk. The University of Maryland Medical Center reports that omega-3 fatty acids promote lower total cholesterol and lower triglycerides in people with high cholesterol.1 It is suggested that people consume omega-3 fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid in their diets regularly. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are especially beneficial to consume because they both lower LDL and elevate HDL, thus contributing to healthy blood cholesterol levels. The study also reveals that saturated and trans fatty acids serve as catalysts for the increase of LDL cholesterol. Additionally, trans fatty acids decrease HDL levels, which can impact negatively on total blood cholesterol. 1.',\n",

Food manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to attack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation render them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules attack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes oxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives the food prepared with it an unappetizing taste.

According to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the following risk factors are controllable: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes, poor diet, physical inactivity, being overweight, and obesity. In light of that, we present the following informational tips to help you define, evaluate, and implement healthy dietary choices to last a lifetime. The amount and the type of fat that composes a person’s dietary profile will have a profound effect upon the way fat and cholesterol is metabolized in the body. Watch Out for Saturated Fat and Cholesterol In proper amounts, cholesterol is a compound used by the body to sustain many important body functions. In excess, cholesterol is harmful if it accumulates in the structures of the body’s vast network of blood vessels. High blood LDL and low blood HDL are major indicators of blood cholesterol risk. The largest influence on blood cholesterol levels rests in the mix of saturated fat and trans fat in the diet. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, for every extra 2 percent of calories from trans fat consumed per day—about the amount found in a midsize order of French fries at a fast-food establishment—the risk of coronary heart disease Lipids and Disease | 345',\n",

How saturated is the fat in your diet?Is it really necessary to eat saturated fat when the body makes all the saturated fat that it needs?Saturated fats should fall into the “bad” category—the body does not demand this kind of fat and it is proven to be a forerunner of cardiovascular disease. In the United States and other developed countries, populations acquire their saturated fat content mostly from meat, seafood, poultry (with skin consumed), and whole-milk dairy products (cheese, milk, and ice cream). Some plant foods are also high in saturated fats, including coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil. Food Cholesterol’s Effect on Blood Cholesterol Dietary cholesterol does have a small impact on overall blood cholesterol levels, but not as much as some people may think. The average American female consumes 237 milligrams of dietary cholesterol per day and for males the figure is slightly higher—about 358 milligrams. Most people display little response to normal dietary cholesterol intake as the body responds by halting its own synthesis of the substance in favor of using the cholesterol obtained 1.',\n",

Don’t be bombarded with gratuitous grams of saturated fats and empty grams of trans fats. Read and decipher food labels carefully so that you know exactly what types of fat a food item contains and how much fat it will contribute to your overall fat intake. For snacks and daily eating, gravitate toward foods that are lowest in or absent of harmful trans fats. Restrict other foods to occasional usage based upon their fat content. For example, if selecting prepared foods, choose the ones without high-fat sauces in favor of adding your own flavorings. If selecting precooked meats, avoid those that are fried, coated, or prepared in high- fat sauces.

Eleven of these are called nonessential amino acids because the body can synthesize them. However, nine of the amino acids are called essential amino acids because we cannot synthesize them either at all or in sufficient amounts. These must be obtained from the diet. Sometimes during infancy, growth, and in diseased states the body cannot synthesize enough of some of the nonessential amino acids and more of them are required in the diet.

Different proteins are produced because there are twenty types of naturally occurring amino acids that are combined in unique sequences to form polypeptides. These polypeptide chains then fold into a three-dimensional shape to form a protein (see Figure 6.3 “Formation of Polypeptides”). Additionally, proteins come in many different sizes. The hormone insulin, which regulates blood glucose, is composed of only fifty-one amino acids; whereas collagen, a protein that acts like glue between cells, consists of more than one thousand amino acids. Titin is the largest known protein. It accounts for the elasticity of muscles, and consists of more than twenty-five thousand amino acids!The abundant variations of proteins are due to the unending number of amino acid sequences that can be formed.

The first step in constructing a protein is the transcription (copying) of the genetic information in double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the single-stranded, messenger macromolecule ribonucleic acid (RNA). RNA is chemically similar to DNA, but has two differences; one is that its backbone uses the sugar ribose and not deoxyribose; and two, it contains the nucleotide base uracil, and not thymidine. The RNA that is transcribed from a given piece of DNA contains the same information as that DNA, but it is now in a form that can be read by the cellular protein manufacturer known as the ribosome. Next, the RNA instructs the cells to gather all the necessary amino acids and add them to the growing protein chain in a very specific order. This process is referred to as translation.

Furthermore, a protein is organized into four different structural levels. Primary: The first level is the one-dimensional sequence of amino acids that are held together by peptide bonds. Carbohydrates and lipids also are one-dimensional sequences of their respective monomers, which may be branched, coiled, fibrous, or globular, but their conformation is much more random and is not organized by their sequence of monomers.

A protein’s structure also influences its nutritional quality. Large fibrous protein structures are more difficult to digest than smaller proteins and some, such as keratin, are indigestible.

When a protein denatures, its complicated folded structure unravels, and it becomes just a long strand of amino acids again. Weak chemical forces that hold tertiary and secondary protein structures together are broken when a protein is exposed to unnatural conditions. Because proteins’ function is dependent on their shape, denatured proteins are no longer functional. During cooking the applied heat causes proteins to vibrate.

The acidity of the stomach facilitates the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the protein aggregates formed during cooking. Pepsin, which is secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein chains into smaller and smaller fragments.

The body has several systems that hold the blood pH within the normal range to prevent this from happening. One of these is the circulating albumin. Albumin is slightly acidic, and because it is negatively charged it balances the many positively charged molecules, such as protons (H+), calcium, potassium, and magnesium which are also circulating in the blood. Albumin acts as a buffer against abrupt changes in the concentrations of these molecules, thereby balancing blood pH and maintaining the status quo. The protein hemoglobin also participates in acid-base balance by binding and releasing protons. Transport Albumin and hemoglobin also play a role in molecular transport. Albumin chemically binds to hormones, fatty acids, some vitamins, essential minerals, and drugs, and transports them throughout the circulatory system. Each red blood cell contains millions of hemoglobin molecules that bind oxygen in the lungs and transport it to all the tissues in the body.',\n",

Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration Proteins are involved in all aspects of wound healing, a process that takes place in three phases: inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling. For example, if you were sewing and pricked your finger with a needle, your flesh would turn red and become inflamed. Within a few seconds bleeding would stop. The healing process begins with proteins such as bradykinin, which dilate blood vessels at the site of injury. An additional protein called fibrin helps to secure platelets that form a clot to stop the bleeding. Next, in the proliferative phase, cells move in and mend the injured tissue by installing newly made collagen fibers.',\n",

While wound healing takes place only after an injury is sustained, a different process called tissue regeneration is ongoing in the body. The main difference between wound healing and tissue regeneration is in the process of regenerating an exact structural and functional copy of the lost tissue. Thus, old, dying tissue is not replaced with scar tissue but with brand new, fully functional tissue.

A healthy diet incorporates all nutrients in moderation. Low protein intake has several health consequences, and a severe lack of protein in the diet eventually causes death. Although severe protein deficiency is a rare occurrence in children and adults in the United States, it is estimated that more than half of the elderly in nursing homes are protein-deficient. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent of kilocalories, which is a fairly wide range. The percent of protein in the diet that is associated with malnutrition and its health consequences is less than 10 percent, but this is often accompanied by deficiencies in calories and other micronutrients. In this section we will discuss the health consequences of protein intake that is either too low to support life’s processes or too high, thereby increasing the risk of chronic disease. In the last section of this chapter, we will discuss in more detail the personal choices you can make to optimize your health by consuming the right amount of high-quality protein. Health Consequences of Protein Deficiency Although severe protein deficiency is rare in the developed world, it is a leading cause of death in children in many poor, underdeveloped countries.

Kwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of the feet and abdomen, poor skin health, growth retardation, low muscle mass, and liver malfunction. Recall that one of protein’s functional roles in the body is fluid balance. Diets extremely low in protein do not provide enough amino acids for the synthesis of albumin. One of the functions of albumin is to hold water in the blood vessels, so having lower concentrations of blood albumin results in water moving out of the blood vessels and into tissues, causing swelling.

However, diets that include lots of red meat are also high in saturated fat and cholesterol and sometimes linked to unhealthy lifestyles, so it is difficult to conclude that the high protein content is the culprit.

Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then transported to the kidneys for excretion.',\n",

The IOM used data from multiple studies that determined nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the RDA for protein. A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the nitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in less protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance occurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken in by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.',\n",

However, this raises another question: if athletes are more efficient at using protein, is it necessary to take in more protein from dietary sources than the average person?There are two scientific schools of thought on this matter. One side believes athletes need more protein and the other thinks the protein requirements of athletes are the same as for nonathletes. There is scientific evidence to support both sides of this debate. The consensus of both sides is that few people exercise at the intensity that makes this debate relevant.',\n",

Is taking protein supplements ever justified, then?Neither protein nor amino acid supplements have been scientifically proven to improve exercise performance or increase strength. In addition, the average American already consumes more protein than is required. Despite these facts, many highly physically active individuals use protein or amino acid supplements. According to the AND, American College of Sports Medicine, and Dietitians of Canada, “the current evidence indicates that protein and amino acid supplements are no more or no less effective than food when energy is adequate for gaining lean body mass.”5 Branched-chain amino acids, such as leucine, are often touted as a way to build muscle tissue and enhance athletic performance.

Although the evidence for protein and amino acid supplements impacting athletic performance is lacking, there is some scientific evidence that supports consuming high-quality dairy proteins, such as casein and whey, and soy proteins positively influences muscle recovery in response to hard training. If you choose to buy a bucket of whey protein, use it to make a protein shake after an intense workout and do not add more than what is required to obtain 20 to 25 grams of protein. As always, choosing high-quality protein foods will help you build muscle and not empty your wallet as much as buying supplements.

For thousands of years, alcohol has been consumed in a medicinal, celebratory, and ritualistic manner. It is drunk in just about every country and often in excessive amounts. Alcohol can be made from a variety of different starch foods through the processes called fermentation. Fermentation of a starchy food such as barley or wheat can produce ethanol and CO2 which makes up what is commonly known as beer. The Native Hawaiians distilled a mash of fermented ti roots in iron try-pots pre-colonization in the 1700s. This form of alcohol was called “Okolehao”. This alcoholic beverage more commonly known today as “moonshine”, is still made locally in the islands today.1 Alcohol is a psychoactive drug.

However, alcohol displays its two-faced character again in its effects on body weight, making many scientific studies contradictory. Multiple studies show high intakes of hard liquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result of the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks, juices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even more so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and in some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory results of scientific studies that have examined the association of alcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that alcohol contributes calories to the diet. When alcohol is drunk in excess, it reduces the secretion of pancreatic juice and damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrient digestion and absorption. The impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients in alcoholics contributes to their characteristic “skinniness” and multiple associated micronutrient deficiencies. The most common macronutrient deficiency among alcoholics is water, as it is excreted in excess. Commonly associated micronutrient deficiencies include thiamine, pyridoxine, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium, and zinc. Furthermore, alcoholics typically replace calories from alcohol with those of nutritious foods, sometimes getting 50 percent or more of their daily caloric intake from alcoholic beverages.',\n",

Higher levels of LDL particles in circulation lead to the build-up of cholesterol deposition plaques inside the walls of the blood vessels (known as atherosclerosis). These plaques can impair or stop blood flow to the cells. If an artery is blocked, the cells cannot make enough energy and eventually stop working. If the artery remains blocked for more than a few minutes, the cells may die. When a cardiac artery is blocked, this causes a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction).

The chemical breakdown of those chemicals provides the energy needed to carry out thousands of body functions that allow the body to perform daily functions and tasks such as breathing, walking up a flight of steps, and studying for a test. Energy is classified as either potential or kinetic. Potential energy is stored energy, or energy waiting to happen. Kinetic energy is energy in motion.

After potential energy is released to provide kinetic energy, it ultimately becomes thermal energy or heat. You can notice this when you exercise and your body heats up. The Calorie Is a Unit of Energy The amount of energy in nutrients or the amount of energy expended by the body can be quantified with a variety of units used to measure energy.

Since calories and Joules are both measures of energy, one can be converted to the other – 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ. Estimating Caloric Content The energy contained in energy-yielding nutrients differs because the energy-yielding nutrients are composed of different types of chemical bonds. The carbohydrate or protein in a food yields approximately 4 kilocalories per gram, whereas the triglycerides that compose the fat in a food yield 9 kilocalories per gram.

Proper nutrition provides the necessary nutrients to make the energy that supports life’s processes. Your body builds new macromolecules from the nutrients in food. Nutrient and Energy Flow Energy is stored in a nutrient’s chemical bonds. Energy comes from sunlight, which plants capture and, via photosynthesis, use it to transform carbon dioxide in the air into the molecule glucose. When the glucose bonds are broken, energy is released. Bacteria, plants, and animals (including humans) harvest the energy in glucose via a biological process called cellular respiration.

Food Quality One measurement of food quality is the amount of nutrients it contains relative to the amount of energy it provides. High-quality foods are nutrient dense, meaning they contain lots of nutrients relative to the amount of calories they provide. Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of “empty-calorie” foods such as carbonated sugary soft drinks, which provide many calories and very little, if any, other nutrients. Food quality is additionally associated with its taste, texture, appearance, microbial content, and how much consumers like it. 458 | Introduction',\n",

Protons and neutrons are contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has a positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted to this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud. Electrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the charge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with one another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending on the number of electrons within an atom. Atoms are more stable when their electrons orbit in pairs.

Metabolism is either categorized as catabolism, referring to all metabolic processes involved in molecule breakdown, or anabolism, which includes all metabolic processes involved in building bigger molecules. Generally, catabolic processes release energy and anabolic processes consume energy. The overall goals of metabolism are energy transfer and matter transport. Energy is transformed from food macronutrients into cellular energy, which is used to perform cellular work. Metabolism transforms the matter of macronutrients into substances a cell can use to grow and reproduce and also into waste products. For example, enzymes are proteins and their job is to catalyze chemical reactions. Catalyze means to speed-up a chemical reaction and reduce the energy required to complete the chemical reaction, without the catalyst being used up in the reaction. Without enzymes, chemical reactions would not happen at a fast enough rate and would use up too much energy for life to exist. A metabolic pathway is a series of enzyme catalyzed reactions that transform the starting material (known as a substrate) into intermediates, that are the substrates for subsequent enzymatic reactions in the pathway, until, finally, an end product is synthesized by the last enzymatic reaction in the pathway.',\n",

Catabolism of food molecules begins when food enters the mouth, as the enzyme salivary amylase initiates the breakdown of the starch in foods. The entire process of digestion converts the large polymers in food to monomers that can be absorbed. Starches are broken down to monosaccharides, lipids are broken down to fatty acids, and proteins are broken down to amino acids. These monomers are absorbed into the bloodstream either directly, as is the case with monosaccharides and amino acids, or repackaged in intestinal cells for transport by an indirect route through lymphatic vessels, as is the case with most fatty acids and other fat-soluble molecules. Once absorbed, water-soluble nutrients first travel to the liver which controls their passage into the blood that transports the nutrients to cells throughout the body. The fat-soluble nutrients gradually pass from the lymphatic vessels into blood flowing to body cells. Cells requiring energy or building blocks take up the nutrients from the blood and process them in either catabolic or anabolic pathways.

Citric Acid Cycle (or Krebs cycle) • Stage 3. Electron Transport Chain and ATP synthesis Figure 8.4 ATP Production Pathway The breakdown of glucose begins with glycolysis, which is a ten- step metabolic pathway yielding two ATP per glucose molecule; glycolysis takes place in the cytosol and does not require oxygen. In addition to ATP, the end-products of glycolysis include two three- carbon molecules, called pyruvate. Pyruvate can either be shuttled to the citric acid cycle to make more ATP or follow an anabolic pathway. If a cell is in negative-energy balance, pyruvate is transported to the mitochondria where it first gets one of its carbons chopped off, yielding acetyl-CoA. The breakdown of fatty acids begins with the catabolic pathway, known as β-oxidation, which takes place in the mitochondria. In this catabolic pathway, four enzymatic steps sequentially remove two-carbon molecules from long chains of fatty acids, yielding acetyl-CoA molecules. In the case of amino acids, once the nitrogen is removed from the amino acid the remaining carbon skeleton can be enzymatically converted into acetyl-CoA or some other intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA, a two-carbon molecule common to glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism enters the second stage of energy metabolism, the citric acid cycle.',\n",

NADH and FADH2 carry the electrons to the inner membrane in the mitochondria where the third stage of energy release takes place, in what is called the electron transport chain. In this metabolic pathway a sequential transfer of electrons between multiple proteins occurs and ATP is synthesized. The entire process of nutrient catabolism is chemically similar to burning, as carbon and hydrogen atoms are\\xa0 combusted (oxidized) producing carbon dioxide, water, and heat. However, the stepwise chemical reactions in nutrient catabolism pathways slow the oxidation of carbon atoms so that much of the energy is captured and not all transformed into heat and light. Complete nutrient catabolism is between 30 and 40 percent efficient, and some of the energy is therefore released as heat. Heat is a vital product of nutrient catabolism and is involved in maintaining body temperature. If cells were too efficient at trapping nutrient energy into ATP, humans would not last to the next meal, as they would die of hypothermia (excessively low body temperature).

A nutrient’s metabolic path is dependent upon energy balance. When you are in a positive energy balance the excess nutrient energy will be stored or used to grow (e.g., during childhood, pregnancy, and wound healing). When you are in negative energy balance you aren’t taking in enough energy to meet your needs, so your body will need to use its stores to provide energy. Energy balance is achieved when intake of energy is equal to energy expended. Weight can be thought of as a whole body estimate of energy balance; body weight is maintained when the body is in energy balance, lost when it is in negative energy balance, and gained when it is in positive energy balance. In general, weight is a good predictor of energy balance, but many other factors play a role in energy intake and energy expenditure. Some of these factors are under your control and others are not.

Estimating Energy Requirement To maintain body weight you have to balance the calories obtained from food and beverages with the calories expended every day. Here, we will discuss how to calculate your energy needs in kilocalories per day so that you can determine whether your caloric intake falls short, meets, or exceeds your energy needs. The Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). It takes into account your age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is calculated for those over 18 years of age via the following formulas: Adult male: EER = 662 − [9.53 X age (y)] + PA X [15.91 X wt (kg) + 5.39.6 X ht (m)] Adult female: EER = 354 − [6.91 x age (y)] + PA x [9.36 x wt (kg) + 726 x ht (m)] Note: to convert pounds to kilograms, divide weight in pounds by 2.2.

Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR.

The energy required for all the enzymatic reactions that take place during food digestion and absorption of nutrients is called the “thermic effect of food” and accounts for about 10 percent of total energy expended per day. The other energy required during the day is for physical activity. Depending on lifestyle, the energy required for this ranges between 15 and 30 percent of total energy expended. The main control a person has over TEE is to increase physical activity. How to Calculate Total Energy Expenditure Calculating TEE can be tedious, but has been made easier as there are now calculators available on the Web. TEE is dependent on age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level. The equations are based on standardized formulas produced from actual measurements on groups of people with similar characteristics. To get accurate results from web-based TEE calculators, it is necessary to record your daily activities and the time spent performing them.

The hypothalamus in the brain is the main control point of appetite. It receives hormonal and neural signals, which determine if you feel hungry or full. Hunger is an unpleasant sensation of feeling empty that is communicated to the brain by both mechanical and chemical signals from the periphery.

Hunger pangs are real and so is a “growling” stomach. When the stomach is empty it contracts, producing the characteristic pang and “growl.”The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus, which relays other neural signals to parts of the brain. This results in the conscious feeling of the need to eat. Alternatively, after you eat a meal the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. The stomach also sends out certain hormones when it is full and others when it is empty. These hormones communicate to the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain either to stop eating or to find some food.',\n",

Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it.1 Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person there is no sustained effect on food intake. Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake. The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis. Both undernutrition and overnutrition affect hormone levels and the neural circuitry controlling appetite, which makes losing or gaining weight a substantial physiological hurdle.

You can begin this task by starting simple, such as requesting extra tomatoes and lettuce on your burger and more nutrient-dense choices in the salad bar. Also, choose their low- calorie menu options and help support the emerging market of healthier choices in the fast food industry. In today’s fast-paced society, it is difficult for most people to avoid fast food all the time. When you do need a quick bite on the run, choose the fast food restaurants that serve healthier foods.

Some believe that this theory provides an explanation as to why after dieting, most people return to their original weight not long after stopping the diet.

A major problem with these theories is that they overgeneralize and do not take into account that not all individuals respond in the same way to changes in food intake or energy expenditure. This brings up the importance of the interactions of genes and the environment. Not all individuals who take a weight-loss drug lose weight and not all people who smoke are thin. An explanation for these discrepancies is that each individual’s genes respond differently to a specific environment. Alternatively, environmental factors can influence a person’s gene profile, which is exemplified by the effects of the prenatal environment on body weight and fatness and disease incidence later in life.1 One example is a study of the offspring of women who were overweight during pregnancy had a greater propensity for being overweight and for developing Type 2 diabetes. Thus, undernutrition and overnutrition during pregnancy influence body weight and disease risk for offspring later in life. They do so by adapting energy metabolism to the early nutrient and hormonal environment in the womb. 1.\\xa0Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al. (',\n",

Moreover, most members eat breakfast every day, watch fewer than ten hours of television per week, and weigh themselves at least once per week. About half of them lost weight on their own, and the other half used some type of weight-loss program. In most scientific studies successful weight loss is accomplished only by changing the diet and by increasing physical activity. Doing one without the other limits the amount of weight lost and the length of time that weight loss is sustained. On an individual level it is quite possible to achieve successful weight loss, as over ten thousand Americans can attest. Moreover, losing as little as 10 percent of your body weight can significantly improve health and reduce disease risk.4 You do not have to be overweight or obese to reap benefits from eating a healthier diet and increasing physical activity as both provide numerous benefits beyond weight loss and maintenance.

The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines provide guidance to Americans aged six and older about how to improve health and reduce chronic disease risk through physical activity. Increased physical activity has been found in scientific studies to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, colon, breast, and lung cancer, falls and fractures, depression, and early death. Increased physical activity not only reduces disease risk, but also improves overall health by increasing cardiovascular and muscular fitness, increasing bone density and strength, improving cognitive function, and assisting in weight loss and weight maintenance.6 The key guidelines for adults are the following (those for pregnant women, children, and older people will be given in Chapter 13): 6.\\xa02008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.

The “Small-Change” Approach Currently, most people are not obese in this country. The gradual rise in overweight is happening because, on average, people consume slightly more calories daily than they expend, resulting in a gradual weight gain of one to two pounds a year. In 2003 the idea was first published that promoting small lifestyle changes to reduce weight gain occurring over time in all age groups may better reduce obesity rates in the American population.10 Scientific studies have demonstrated that asking people to increase the number of steps they take each day while providing them with pedometers that count the steps they take each day successfully prevented weight gain. A “small-changes” study published in the October 2007 issue of Pediatrics evaluated whether families that made two small lifestyle changes, which were to walk an additional two thousand steps per day and to eliminate 100 kilocalories per day from their typical diet by replacing dietary sugar with a noncaloric sweetener, would prevent weight gain in 10.\\xa0Hill JO.

Vitamins are absorbed primarily in the small intestine and their bioavailability is dependent on the food composition of the diet. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fat. Therefore, if a meal is very low in fat, the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins will be impaired. Once fat-soluble vitamins have been absorbed in the small intestine, they are packaged and incorporated into chylomicrons along with other fatty acids and transported in the lymphatic system to the liver. Water-soluble vitamins on the other hand are absorbed in the small intestine but are transported to the liver through blood vessels.

Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived foods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms of vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes referred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant- derived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in the body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin A. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them their yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids have been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found in the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the xanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do not. In plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and act as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta- cryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body. The other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological actions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity, but they likely act by other mechanisms, too.

This is why night blindness is the most definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A has several important functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a healthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body are similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can interact with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A assists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of tissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant, vitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining glutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of enzymes that detoxify free radicals. Vision Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the eye retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used to help the pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see under low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in less rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a condition referred to as night-blindness.',\n",

In Asia in the late 1980s, targeted populations of children were administered vitamin A supplements, and the death rates from measles and diarrhea declined by up to 50 percent. Vitamin A supplementation in these deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the diseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results of these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns against vitamin A deficiency. UNICEF estimates that the distribution of over half a billion vitamin A capsules prevents 350,000 childhood deaths annually.1 In the twenty-first century, science has demonstrated that vitamin A greatly affects the immune system. What we are still lacking are clinical trials investigating the proper doses of vitamin A required to help ward off infectious disease and how large of an effect vitamin A supplementation has on populations that are not deficient in this vitamin. This brings up one of our common themes in this text—micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to the development, progression, and severity of a disease, but this does not mean that an increased intake of these micronutrients will solely prevent or cure disease. The effect, as usual, is cumulative and depends on the diet as a whole, among other things. 1.\\xa0Sommer A. (2008).',\n",

Vitamin K Functions and Health Benefits Vitamin K refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins that are similar in chemical structure. Vitamin K is critical for blood function acting as coenzymes which play an essential role in blood coagulation (aka blood clotting). Blood-clotting proteins are continuously circulating in the blood. Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets stick to the wound forming a plug. Without vitamin K, blood would not clot. A deficiency in vitamin K causes bleeding disorders. It is relatively rare, but people who have liver or pancreatic disease, celiac disease, or malabsorption conditions are at higher risk for vitamin K deficiency.

For the vitamin C content of various foods, see Table 9.12 “Vitamin C Content of Various Foods”.

It acts as a cofactor for enzymes that break down glucose for energy production (Figure 9.7 “Enzyme Active Site for Cofactors” ). Thiamin plays a key role in nerve cells as the glucose that is catabolized by thiamin is needed for an energy source. Additionally, thiamin plays a role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and is therefore required for RNA, DNA, and ATP synthesis. The brain and heart are most affected by a deficiency in thiamin. Thiamin deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause symptoms of fatigue, confusion, movement impairment, pain in the lower extremities, swelling, and heart failure. It is prevalent in societies whose main dietary staple is white rice. During the processing of white rice, the bran is removed, along with what were called in the early nineteenth century, “accessory factors,” that are vital for metabolism. Dutch physician Dr. Christiaan Eijkman cured chickens of beriberi by feeding them unpolished rice bran in 1897. By 1912, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins determined from his experiments with animals that the “accessory factors,” eventually renamed vitamins, are needed in the diet to support growth, since animals fed a diet of pure carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and minerals failed to grow.4Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology (or Medicine) in 1929 for their discoveries in the emerging science of nutrition.',\n",

Niacin (B3) Niacin is a component of the coenzymes NADH and NADPH, which are involved in the catabolism and/or anabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. NADH is the predominant electron carrier and transfers electrons to the electron-transport chain to make ATP. NADPH is also required for the anabolic pathways of fatty-acid and cholesterol synthesis. In contrast to other vitamins, niacin can be synthesized by humans from the amino acid tryptophan in an anabolic process requiring enzymes dependent on riboflavin, vitamin B6, and iron. Niacin is made from tryptophan only after tryptophan has met all of its other needs in the body. The contribution of tryptophan-derived niacin to niacin needs in the body varies widely and a few scientific studies have demonstrated that diets high in tryptophan have very little effect on niacin deficiency.',\n",

Additionally, results of clinical trials have demonstrated that neural-tube defects are significantly decreased in the offspring of mothers who began taking folate supplements one month prior to becoming pregnant and throughout the pregnancy.

Impairment of secretion of this protein either caused by an autoimmune disease or by chronic inflammation of the stomach (such as that occurring in some people with H.pylori infection), can lead to the disease pernicious anemia, a type of macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B12 malabsorption is most common in the elderly, who may have impaired functioning of digestive organs, a normal consequence of aging.

B vitamins are naturally present in numerous foods, and many other foods are enriched with them. In the United States, B-vitamin deficiencies are rare; however in the nineteenth century some vitamin-B deficiencies plagued many people in North America. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, was prominent in poorer Americans whose main dietary staple was refined cornmeal. Its symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and even death. Some of the health consequences of pellagra are the result of niacin being in insufficient supply to support the body’s metabolic functions.',\n",

Based on the antioxidant-supplement industry’s success, the general public appears to believe these health claims. However, these claims are not backed by scientific evidence; rather, there is some evidence suggesting supplements can actually cause harm. While scientists have found evidence supporting the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods as a method of reducing the risk of chronic disease, there is no “miracle cure”; no pill or supplement alone can provide the same benefits as a healthy diet. Remember, it is the combination of antioxidants and other nutrients in healthy foods that is beneficial. In this section, we will review how particular antioxidants function in the body, learn how they work together to protect the body against free radicals, and explore the best nutrient-rich dietary sources of antioxidants.

For example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader (such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is thus neutralized. Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide acts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites, meaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut. Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as well. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide, which is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free radicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with proteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical nitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a chemical messenger in the brain. By acting as signaling molecules, free radicals are involved in the control of their own synthesis, stress responses, regulation of cell growth and death, and metabolism.',\n",

Sustained oxidative damage results only under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and repair systems are insufficient.

Phytochemicals are present in small amounts in the food supply, and although thousands have been and are currently being scientifically studied, their health benefits remain largely unknown. Also largely unknown is their potential for toxicity, which could be substantial if taken in large amounts in the form of supplements. Moreover, phytochemicals often act in conjunction with each other and with micronutrients. Thus, supplementing with only a few may impair the functions of other phytochemicals or micronutrients.

Although only 1 percent of the calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues, it is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby releasing stored calcium into the blood.\\xa0Thus, bone tissue sacrifices its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone health is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why blood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake. Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the body like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue.',\n",

Calcium is also essential in blood clotting by activating clotting factors to fix damaged tissue. In addition to calcium’s four primary functions calcium has several other minor functions that are also critical for maintaining normal physiology. For example, without calcium, the hormone insulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and glycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to provide energy for muscle contraction. Maintaining Calcium Levels Because calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood calcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels are low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three different mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium stored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase calcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third, PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to calcitriol.\\xa0Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal cells and increases dietary calcium absorption.',\n",

Another health benefit of a high-calcium diet is that it blocks kidney stone formation. Calcium inhibits the absorption of oxalate, a chemical in plants such as parsley and spinach, which is associated with an increased risk for developing kidney stones.

This is partly attributed to the fact that dietary sources of calcium supply additional nutrients with health-promoting activities. It is reported that chelated forms of calcium supplements are easier to absorb as the chelation process protects the calcium from oxalates and phytates that may bind with the calcium in the intestines. However, these are more expensive supplements and only increase calcium absorption up to 10 percent. In people with low dietary intakes of calcium, calcium supplements have a negligible benefit on bone health in the absence of a vitamin D supplement. However, when calcium supplements are taken along with vitamin D, there are many benefits to bone health: peak bone mass is increased in early adulthood, BMD is maintained throughout adulthood, the risk of developing osteoporosis is reduced, and the incidence of fractures is decreased in those who already had osteoporosis. Calcium and vitamin D pills do not have to be taken at the same time for effectiveness. But remember that vitamin D has to be activated and in the bloodstream to promote calcium absorption. Thus, it is important to maintain an adequate intake of vitamin D.

Studies have shown that a higher intake of calcium during puberty increases the total amount of bone tissue that accumulates in a person. For women above age fifty and men older than seventy-one, the RDAs are also a bit higher for several reasons including that as we age, calcium absorption in the gut decreases, vitamin D3 activation is reduced, and maintaining adequate blood levels of calcium is important to prevent an acceleration of bone tissue loss (especially during menopause). Currently, the dietary intake of calcium for females above age nine is, on average, below the RDA for calcium.

The hormone estrogen is another factor that enhances calcium bioavailability. Thus, as a woman ages and goes through menopause, during which estrogen levels fall, the amount of calcium absorbed decreases and the risk for bone disease increases. Some fibers, such as inulin, found in jicama, onions, and garlic, also promote calcium intestinal uptake. Chemicals that bind to calcium decrease its bioavailability. These negative effectors of calcium absorption include the oxalates in certain plants, the tannins in tea, phytates in nuts, seeds, and grains, and some fibers.

Observational studies link magnesium deficiency with an increased risk for osteoporosis. A magnesium- deficient diet is associated with decreased levels of parathyroid hormone and the activation of vitamin D, which may lead to an impairment of bone remodeling. A study in nine hundred elderly women and men did show that higher dietary intakes of magnesium correlated to an increased BMD in the hip.1 Only a few clinical trials have evaluated the effects of magnesium supplements on bone health and their results suggest some modest benefits on BMD.

Iron is needed for the production of other iron-containing proteins such as myoglobin.\\xa0Myoglobin is a protein found in the muscle tissues that enhances the amount of available oxygen for muscle contraction. Iron is also a key component of hundreds of metabolic enzymes. Many of the proteins of the electron-transport chain contain iron–sulfur clusters involved in the transfer of high-energy electrons and ultimately ATP synthesis. Iron is also involved in numerous metabolic reactions that take place mainly in the liver and detoxify harmful substances. Moreover, iron is required for DNA synthesis.

The iron in hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the capillaries of the lungs and transports it to cells where the oxygen is released. If iron level is low hemoglobin is not synthesized in sufficient amounts and the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is reduced, resulting in anemia. When iron levels are low in the diet the small intestine more efficiently absorbs iron in an attempt to compensate for the low dietary intake, but this process cannot make up for the excessive loss of iron that occurs with chronic blood loss or low intake. When blood cells are decommissioned for use, the body recycles the iron back to the bone marrow where red blood cells are made. The body stores some iron in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, and skeletal muscle. A relatively small amount of iron is excreted when cells lining the small intestine and skin cells die and in blood loss, such as during menstrual bleeding. The lost iron must be replaced from dietary sources. The bioavailability of iron is highly dependent on dietary sources.',\n",

Anemia is most often treated with iron supplements and increasing the consumption of foods that are higher in iron. Iron supplements have some adverse side effects including nausea, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Reducing the dose at first and then gradually increasing to the full dose often minimizes the side effects of iron supplements. Avoiding foods and beverages high in phytates and also tea (which contains tannic acid and polyphenols, both of which impair iron absorption), is important for people who have iron-deficiency anemia. Eating a dietary source of vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing foods improves absorption of nonheme iron in the gut. Additionally, unknown compounds that likely reside in muscle tissue of meat, poultry, and fish increase iron absorption from both heme and nonheme sources. See Table 17.2 “Enhancers and Inhibitors of Iron Absorption” for more enhancers and inhibitors for iron absorption.

Preventing Iron-Deficiency Anemia In young children iron-deficiency anemia can cause significant motor, mental, and behavioral abnormalities that are long-lasting. In the United States, the high incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in infants and children was a major public-health problem prior to the early 1970s, but now the incidence has been greatly reduced. This achievement was accomplished by implementing the screening of infants for iron-deficiency anemia in the health sector as a common practice, advocating the fortification of infant formulas and cereals with iron, and distributing them in supplemental food programs, such as that within Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Breastfeeding, iron supplementation, and delaying the introduction of cow’s milk for at least the first twelve months of life were also encouraged. These practices were implemented across the socioeconomic spectrum and by the 1980s iron-deficiency anemia in infants had significantly declined. Other solutions had to be introduced in young children, who no longer were fed breast milk or fortified formulas and were consuming cow’s milk. The following solutions were introduced to parents: provide a diet rich in sources of iron and vitamin C, limit cow’s milk consumption to less than twenty-four ounces per day, and a multivitamin containing iron.

Zinc also is a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism. As the result of its prominent roles in anabolic and energy metabolism, a zinc deficiency in infants and children blunts growth. The reliance of growth on adequate dietary zinc was discovered in the early 1960s in the Middle East where adolescent nutritional dwarfism was linked to diets containing high amounts of phytate. Cereal grains and some vegetables contain chemicals, one being phytate, which blocks the absorption of zinc and other minerals in the gut. It is estimated that half of the world’s population has a zinc-deficient diet.1 This is largely a consequence of the lack of red meat and seafood in the diet and reliance on cereal grains as the main dietary staple. In adults, severe zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, diarrhea, skin sores, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Zinc is a required cofactor for an enzyme that synthesizes the heme portion of hemoglobin and severely deficient zinc diets can result in anemia. 1.\\xa0Prasad, Ananda. (',\n",

The other important function of selenium is as an antioxidant. Selenium Functions and Health Benefits Around twenty-five known proteins require selenium to function. Some are enzymes involved in detoxifying free radicals and include glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase. As an integral functioning part of these enzymes, selenium aids in the regeneration of glutathione and oxidized vitamin C. Selenium as part of glutathione peroxidase also protects lipids from free radicals, and, in doing so, spares vitamin E. This is just one example of how antioxidants work together to protect the body against free- radical induced damage. Other functions of selenium-containing proteins include protecting endothelial cells that line tissues, converting the inactive thyroid hormone to the active form in cells, and mediating inflammatory and immune system responses. Observational studies have demonstrated that selenium deficiency is linked to an increased risk of cancer. A review of forty- nine observational studies published in the May 2011 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews concluded that higher selenium exposure reduces overall cancer incidence by about 34 percent in men and 10 percent in women, but notes these studies had several limitations, including data quality, bias, and large Selenium | 675',\n",

Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormone, which regulates basal metabolism, growth, and development. Low iodine levels and consequently hypothyroidism has many signs and symptoms including fatigue, sensitivity to cold, constipation, weight gain, depression, and dry, itchy skin and paleness. The development of goiter may often be the most visible sign of chronic iodine deficiency, but the consequences of low levels of thyroid hormone can be severe during infancy, childhood, and adolescence as it affects all stages of growth and development. Thyroid hormone plays a major role in brain development and growth and fetuses and infants with severe iodine deficiency develop a condition known as cretinism, in which physical and neurological impairment can be severe. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates iodine deficiency affects over two billion people worldwide and it is the number-one cause of preventable brain damage worldwide.1 Figure 11.5 Deaths Due to Iodine Deficiency Worldwide in 2012 1.\\xa0World Health Organization. “Iodine Status Worldwide.” Accessed October 2, 2011.http:/ /whqlibdoc.who.int/ publications/2004/9241592001.pdf.',\n",

It enhances the actions of insulin so it plays a role in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Currently, the results of scientific studies evaluating the usefulness of chromium supplementation in preventing and treating Type 2 diabetes are largely inconclusive. More research is needed to better determine if chromium is helpful in treating certain chronic diseases and, if so, at what doses. If a deficiency of chromium occurs in the body, signs and symptoms include weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, elevated plasma glucose concentrations or impaired glucose use, and high plasma free fatty acid concentrations. Although toxicity of the mineral is a low risk in humans, it can cause DNA damage, organ damage, and renal problems. Tissues that are high in chromium include the liver, spleen, and bone.1 Dietary Reference Intakes for Chromium The recommended intake for chromium is 35 mcg per day for adult males and 25 mcg per day for adult females.

Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase BMD. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases BMD in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known and it has several side effects including frequent stomach upset and joint pain.

For example, many Pacific Islanders have been unable to maintain their traditional diets for various environmental, social and demographic reasons. This has resulted in diets high in a variety of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods. Frequent inadequate and/or excessive nutrient intake can lead to many health issues in a community such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Therefore, it is important to employ moderation and portion control by using all of the principles together to afford you lasting health benefits1. 1.\\xa0Pacific Food Summit: Factsheet. (2010).

This DRI system is used in both the United States and Canada. Dietary Reference Intakes: A Brief Overview “Dietary Reference Intakes” (DRI) is an umbrella term for four reference values: • Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) • Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) • Adequate Intakes (AI) • Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL) The DRIs are not minimum or maximum nutritional requirements and are not intended to fit everybody. They are to be used as guides only for the majority of the healthy population1. 1.\\xa0Deng S, West BJ, Jensen CJ. (2010).

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'DRIs are important not only to help the average person determine whether their intake of a particular nutrient is adequate, they are also used by health-care professionals and policy makers to determine nutritional recommendations for special groups of people who may need help reaching nutritional goals. This includes people who are participating in programs such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The DRI is not appropriate for people who are ill or malnourished, even if they were healthy previously. Determining Dietary Reference Intakes Each DRI value is derived in a different way. See below for an explanation of how each is determined: 1. Estimated Average Requirements. The EAR for a nutrient is determined by a committee of nutrition experts who review the scientific literature to determine a value that meets the requirements of 50 percent of people in their target group within a given life stage and for a particular sex. The requirements of half of the group will fall below the EAR and the other half will be above it. It is important to note that, for each nutrient, a specific bodily function is chosen as the criterion on which to base the EAR. For example, the EAR for calcium is set using a criterion of maximizing bone health.',\n",

       "'often. • Calm your “sweet tooth” by eating fruits, such as berries or an apple. • Replace sugary soft drinks with seltzer water, tea, or a small amount of 100 percent fruit juice added to water or soda water. The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk, coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods. Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses, and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as a glossy appearance and smooth texture.'"

The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk, coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods. Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses, and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as a glossy appearance and smooth texture.',\n",
