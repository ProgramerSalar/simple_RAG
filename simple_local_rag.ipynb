The average person consumes 3,400 milligrams of sodium per  day, mostly in the form of table salt. The Dietary Guidelines  recommend that Americans reduce their daily sodium intake to  less than 2,300 milligrams. If you are over the age of fifty-one, are  African American, or have cardiovascular risk factors, such as high  blood pressure or diabetes, sodium intake should be reduced even  further to 1,500 milligrams. The Dietary Guidelines also recommend  that less than 10 percent of calories come from saturated fat, and  that fat calories should be obtained by eating foods high in  unsaturated fatty acids. The Dietary Guidelines stress the  importance of limiting the consumption of foods with refined grains  and added sugars, and introduce the new term, SoFAS, which is an  acronym for solid fats and added sugars, both of which should be  consumed in moderation in a healthy diet5.  Foods and Nutrients to Increase  The typical American diet lacks sufficient amounts of vegetables,  fruits, whole grains, and high-calcium foods, causing concern for  deficiencies in certain nutrients important for maintaining health.  The Dietary Guidelines provide the following suggestions on food  choices to achieve a healthier diet:  5.\\xa0Nelson, J. and K. Zeratsky. Dietary Guidelines Connect  SoFAS and Weight Gain.
